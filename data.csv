0,✅ Trip Verified |  Requested a gluten free meal and was given a regular meal. I even double checked at check in about my request and although the staff couldn’t see my request was told it will be fine which it wasn’t.
1,"Not Verified | Worst planes I have ever been in while taking an international flight. I took same flight from Melbourne to Delhi with in a span of two weeks and both times flight was same. Flight entertainment didn't work both times even though it is direct flight for 12.5hours, Mobile charging USB plugs didn't work and Flight crew went to sleep after serving breakfast. You can imagine the torture of sitting on tiny seat with no entertainment, no mobile phone and no service. When I raised concern with customer care, they first promised to fix it by giving me 200 FFF points but then I said I prefer better service and I am happy to donate my points, then they offered me 25% of of the total flights I took. But no, nothing was given. I sent emails twice to see progress but after 3 months, nothing has been done. I paid almost double coz it was a direct flight and both times it was torture."
2,"Not Verified | I have been flying for the past 21 years and never have I seen such a poorly conditioned International flight. Your flight was disgusting and dirty. The toilet situation was horrendous and had a disgusting smell all the time. Also, your entertainment service was not available for the entire 15 hr flight. The meals were exceptionally nasty and tasteless. It is such a shame to represent India with this kind of flight. The only part I was satisfied with was the service from one of your staff. She was kind and nice to everyone. I am not writing this review with the hope that you will address all your flight issues but at least I want you to acknowledge the horrible service you are providing."
3,"✅ Trip Verified | Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in."
4,"Not Verified |  My flight was supposed to depart New Delhi at 2300hrs. It was first delayed until 0200hrs on the following day. Closer to the time, they delayed it further to 0500hrs. No reason provided. I am still at the airport in New Delhi. Do not know if they will delay it, most disappointed with this supposedly new era of Air India. In May 23 also travelled in this airline when we found the food on board was inedible and the inflight entertainment system was not working. It's was on the premium sector of London to New Delhi."
5,"✅ Trip Verified |  I took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate. The online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly. Boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger A321 for this sector. I had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see. Also surprisingly on this flight sector I had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich. I had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good. Landing and arrival into BLR was also well ahead of time. However when the time came to collect the baggage, I had noticed that again the new bag tag which I had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that I had just purchased recently and put. Even last week when I travelled from Kolkata to Mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off, so it seems that Air India is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into. But other than that, this was a welcome flight and I am hoping that the next time I travel, they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give."
6,"Not Verified | Flight to go to India was 9 hrs delayed. Today flew back to Italy 7 hrs delay. No service, nothing this is a company to really avoid! Most of international flights delayed. Bad company, never never use again."
7,"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent service provided by staff. The air hostesses, Praveet and Preeti, were exceptional in their duties and displayed a remarkable level of professionalism throughout the flight. While the overall service was commendable, I would like to bring to your attention a minor issue regarding the in-flight entertainment system. Unfortunately, the screens in our section were not working properly. "
8,"Not Verified | Bad experience. 2 long flights, 6 hours delay without compensation. On both flights, the sockets and the entertainment did not work. Not mine, nor the socket of the adjacent seats. The cabin staff is nice and pretends that the problem is solvable, but they seem pretty aware that it is not. For the delay, upon request, a ticket was provided for a lounge which was actually a loud café offering another meal very much like the one on the plane, and 0.33 ml water."
9,"✅ Trip Verified |  With Tata having purchased Air India and Air India being a Star Alliance partner I thought what could go wrong. My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley. The food was the worst of any airline food I've eaten or tried to eat. The beverage service was miserly. Nope. One and done. Loved India. Been there several times. Will go again just not on Air India."
10,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I had booked this flight at a discount rate, I was a bit anxious about whether I would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally. To my surprise, I didn't have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass. The flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats. For breakfast I opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam, sev upma, a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good. However, during the beverage service, I noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didn't bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise. Perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasn't good. Arrival to Mumbai was on time however I had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage, my baggage name tag that I had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in January too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into. I would still recommend as I got huge value for the fare that I paid."
11,"✅ Trip Verified | I travelled in direct flight from Toronto to Delhi with my brother on 26 June 2023. The entire plane smelled like public washroom. It was so disgusting. The entertainment screen was not working for me and my brother and for many more people. We informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon. Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest. WE PAID $2300 CAD for the ticket which I think was not worth it. This was probably my first and last flight with Air India. Never travelling again and won't even recommend it to anyone."
12,"✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately again experiencing this airline, and it’s air-conditioning not working. We all are sitting and waiting for more than 40 minutes in plane without air-conditioning right away. Again bad experience."
13,✅ Trip Verified |  Totally uncomfortable seats and again entertainment system is not working and even power outlet is not working. This is my 3rd trip and same all 3 times. Seems like this is my last flight with Air India. No value for money.
14,"✅ Trip Verified | I never write reviews, this is the first time I am giving my feedback. Me and my family were traveling to London last month by Air India. I would like to say that their Flights are really in bad conditions. Food was not cooked. Chicken they served was uncooked. TV screens were not working at all, while going to London only one screen was working from our row. But while returning back all three screens were not in a working condition. Also I had ordered a kids meal for my baby, but they also forgot that. If we had called them for any assistance there was nobody there to help. Staff were in their own world. I will never recommend this airline to anybody."
15,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst quality of food provided. The paneer roll was uncooked and not baked properly. No tray for breakfast was given. No tissue paper was given. No water in urinals.
16,"Not Verified |  Worst flight. First time I travel on Air India and this will be the last time. Food quality is the worst, no entertainment, screens are not working for almost 50 percent of flight and the the response from air hostess is they will provide magazines to read. They dont keep the washrooms clean for a 15 hour flight. I would say never travel Air India."
17,"Not Verified |  Just dreading my return flight to Melbourne on Air India, a junk airline that does not have any in-flight equipment working. No entertainment, no call lights, no seat reclining. A personal message to avoid Air India even if given free tickets. Gone are the days of the Maharaja of the skies."
18,"Not Verified |  In flight staff are unprofessional and none of the things (charging point, entertainment screen, no proper ventilation) are working in-flight. Airport ground staffs were equally unprofessional! They keep on asking stranded passengers to follow them unknowingly without proper and definitive reasons and explanations. HIGH miscommunication levels between staffs and passengers. Zero empathy and even shouted at passengers for not following their orders. Flights were delayed, cancelled, changed to a new flight, delayed again. A terrible nightmare."
19,"Not Verified |  Reached 3 hours prior to departure time. Took more than 45 minutes for baggage check in due to less staff at the check in counters Even after repeated feedback, nothing was done Disappointed!"
20,"✅ Trip Verified | I had the opportunity to travel on AI flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to India. I haven't been adventurous enough to try them out international as I've heard my share of horror stories. I'm going to base my review on the 2 Pune-Delhi flights I've taken in this period. Booking: AI fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines. AI is full service. Which means 25 kgs of check-in luggage and meals served on-board. A huge win right away. Online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites. Rating: 10/10 Check In: The check-in counter for AI literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones. That did make me somewhat nervous the first time. As it turns out eventually, the flights both times were completely full so I have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at check-in. Maybe fewer flights? Nevertheless, the check-in agent was quick, efficient, polite, addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate. I was out and about in no time - both times. No complaints. Rating: 10/10 Boarding: Boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled. On both the flights I took. However the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time. Rating: 8/10 Crew: On both occasions, the cabin stewards / stewardesses were polite, efficient and thoroughly professional. Albeit the first flight, they weren't overly keen to smile. On the second flight, they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please. A very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience. 10/10 The craft: This was an older A320. Not the Neo version. Strangely, there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and I had (non working) screen controls. None of the others did. I guess, they reused some seats from other aircraft. The seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers. At 5ft7, I had decent enough knee room. But the seat width - that was definitely a bonus. Wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights, but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer A350s and B787s. That made a huge impact and I did not have to fight it out with my co-passenger for rights over the arm rest. Of course, the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics. But it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting. Rating: 7/10 Meals: Dinner was served. Chicken korma with rice and some veggies. Some yoghurt and a brownie cake. Was decent fare. Served with steel cutlery. Thank you AI! International carriers make note, it's criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery. Why do you do it? The cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and I did a stress test, it was actually quite rigid and strong. Well done. Service was quick and as efficient as how I was getting used to by now. 8/10 Punctuality: Both times on AI, the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached New Delhi 30-35 mins ahead of schedule! I repeat - 30-35 mins ahead of schedule. On a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs!! This is serious WOW. Super impressed. 10/10! Extras: Throughout the trip, I kept getting emails and SMSs from AI with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info. I even got alerts for when my bags were loaded onto the aircraft. Who does that?! Whopping 10/10 Overall: An overwhelmingly surprised 10/10."
21,"Not Verified |  There was a 2hr baggage clearance at Mumbai connection. This caused us to miss the flight, and reschedule it for next day. The hotel and food are horrible. Next day again the rescheduled flight was delayed for couple of hours due to technical issues. Worst experience ever, and I will not recommend anyone to board an Air India flight. The staffs and support center has no experience handling these situations."
22,✅ Trip Verified | The airline seats are absolutely atrocious. The seat fabric is filthy so much so that I didn't want to sit on it. But when I did I realised the seat backs are just flat cardboard and wood. Far worse than the seats on Chennai's local buses. I was really shocked and disgusted and won't ever fly Air India again.
23,"Not Verified | The flight legroom was good, that the only positive side I could remember. The service is horrible, food and drink menu absolutely rubbish. So selection for non-veg. More over the food not even pack individually, serving like buffet. When web check in not even give option to choose meal type. I don't know the cabin crew do feedback to company. This is not one time my parents travelled up and down Cochin to Gatwick had same service, not all human beings are potato and lentil eaters."
24,"Not Verified | Worst Airlines and worst customer support. My flight got cancelled 2 days before departure and I was not even sent a notification or message or any email regarding the same. I had contacted the customer care about problem of not being able to check in, it was then they told me. They didn't even care enough to book another flight just initiated the refund, but now I have to bear that additional cost of booking another flight at last minute."
25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience. After making us sit inside the plane they announced that flight delayed by one hour due to congestion, no news after even two hours and then started giving us excuses like ground staff clearance and after 6 hours sitting in the plane they started fueling. There were a lot of arguments in the plane with staff and ground clearance but they never listened. Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak. The pilot never came out of the cockpit to speak to the passengers, never seen such kind of chaos. Will never fly air india"
26,"Not Verified |  The web check-in was harrowing, they disabled the default free seat that was assigned after selecting another seat, and there was no way to return to the default option. This is a bit of a scam when one is forced to pay for a seat equivalent to the auto-assigned seat. The customer service was of no help at all."
27,Not Verified |  Air India now owned by Tatas but overall service and customer experience still lacking and poor. I travelled from Singapore to Bangalore and then boarded Air India. The flight left my baggage at Bangalore and I had to waste 2 hrs in Mumbai airport. I was told that in my baggage side pocket there was a lighter. I acknowledged and appreciated their promptness. On my return the flight was again delayed by 2 hrs. Someone opened my bag and lifted it. The food served inflight during lunch was also pathetic. I had planned to have my lunch in Bangalore however due to a delay had to rely on Air India. I just had sweet yogurt and returned the rest. Thank you for landing me safely.
28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall good customer service, quick check-in, 3 meals on Syd - Del sector and one meal Del - BOM sector. Staff were attentive and courteous. decent leg space. Normally 787 has a high level of humidity and moisture but these aircraft were very dry don't know did they change the settings as a result you feel quite dry on these flights. I was lucky my entertainment unit worked but the volume is always high. The aircraft was clean, but their bathroom stinks. Except for the bathroom and entertainment, all went well."
29,"✅ Trip Verified |  With mechanical fault they held passengers for nearly 4 hours on flight, then authority did not get any responsibility over them. Still no replacement flight when I am writing this review."
30,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a flight AI127 from New Delhi to Chicago on June 2023. I was accompanied with my 5 year old daughter. My daughter was super excited to go to USA and she said I will watch TV and play games to kill the time since she is not comfortable with long travel. Our seat number was good. To our shock, the seat was completely broken, no headphones were working, the touch was off and the button to adjust the seat was also broken. So, just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours. I am taking Air India off my list now, never ever travelling back in Air India again. We complained to the Air Hostess, she said, ""Yeah can't help it, I will reboot the system, there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you"" but she did not do anything. I felt like jumping off the flight, my daughter was crying for the screen to play some games but I was so helpless. Air hostess doesn’t have a smiley face, they were in a angry face and we couldn’t feel to ask anything if we need."
31,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst inflight experience I’ve ever had. TV Screens not working nor there is a facility to call crew, seats are broken and the food served was pathetic. Had to wait for 3/4 hours to get even water during flight. Heard Bad reviews about Air India before and thought there will be improvements after Its acquired by Tata but no difference. Never travel again if possible completely avoid."
32,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India has very poor customer service onboard the aircraft. No flight attendant came to even offer water after 3-4 hours. Snacks were given before the beginning of the flight. In 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided, there was also no warm food. Customer service is getting worse day by day. Everyone expected that since Mr. Ratan Tata took over Air India, he would make necessary steps to improve customer service, make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including TV screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved. It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto. I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight? This is ridiculous and I hope my message reaches the right authority in India to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport. If I still had option for travelling with Jet Airways, I would never ever travel with Air India. Sadly, Jet Airways is no longer active."
33,"Not Verified |  Good experience overall. Positives: Great leg room for the long flight. Warm staff, higher check-in limits (25Kg) and smooth landing. Areas of Improvement: Food could be a tad better (but its still decent), Punctuality."
34,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a bad experience flying Air India, My flight from JFK to Bangalore with 2 hours Lay over at Mumbai. Ticket was booked 30 days in advance . 1 day before my journey Airindia cancelled my connecting flight from Mumbai to Bangalore and scheduled next flight which is after 16 hours, when asked customer service all i get a response stating flight is cancelled because of technical reason. When asked to change the itinerary they want me to pay extra amount for seat. This is absolutely ridiculous where they have no remorse on their mistake and hardly any empathy on customer inconvenience caused by them. This is my last time flying Air India"
35,"✅ Trip Verified | Can an airline be this inefficient! From beginning to end! AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip. This is the second time I have flown AI in 6 months, for lack of finding any other airline and this is the second time I’ve sat in the plane for 4 hours while technical issues are being dealt with! I would give this negative stars if the option were available!"
36,"✅ Trip Verified | Had a wonderful experience flying with Air India business class flight to Cochin. The crew were extremely welcoming. Service was to the best standard and we reached cochin earlier than the arrival time. I felt I should take time out to thank the lovely ladies Jeneeta and Aanchal who made the flying experience comfortable. Aanchal helped me with the breakfast, her presentation and confidence was worth a praise. Jeneeta (Apologies if the name is misspelled), was caring and helped with patiently with my charging issue. Overall I'm highly impressed with my flying experience with Air India and also booked my return tickers to Sydney with them."
37,Not Verified | We at 6.45 am are still waiting for the cabin crew to arrive for the flight which was supposed to board by 5.10 am. The cabin crew not arrived yet. This has caused a suffering to so many passengers. All of us are stuck because of the captain and his crew members. Can the Air India never improve?
38,"Not Verified |  Worst flight experience, which includes boarding airport service etc. Even if you have to pay extra dollars please prefer to use any other airlines. Never had this flight experience anywhere before. Poor customer care, grumpy hostess, unhygienic food. They don’t care about passengers."
39,"Not Verified | The flight was great! The staff were extremely kind and helpful, the entertainment system were very easy-to-use and the food was really good as well. The inside of the flight was very nice (All Air India flights are being renovated to match or be even better than the likes of Emirates and Qatar Airways). This was one of the best flights I have been on, better than British Airways, Etihad and tied to Lufthansa."
40,"Not Verified | My flight from Dubai to Delhi on 13th June was horrendous, flight was delayed for 2 hours. I'm okay with delay but when we started boarding they were checking our hand luggage weight and supposedly it has to be 8 kgs at Max but they allowed 12 kgs to go through as well. When I sat on my allocated seat my IFE system wasn't working. Not only for me but the column 30-40 ABC. Our hostess were not professional. The food was served 45 mins before landing as they ran out of food. All in all the worst flight experience with Air India for me."
41,"Not Verified | One can keep writing a negative review endlessly if unluckily he has traveled by Air India, but I'll keep it short, and here is my review: The flight was delayed by 5 hours. Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food, I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore. Best of luck to those who still want to try flying with Air India."
42,"Not Verified | No proper response from any of the staff. Hiding all the information about flight timings. Flight got delayed for more than 14 hours. After entering into flight again a delay of one more hour for the staff to come. And the passengers with connecting international flight from Mumbai suffered a lot because of these delays. One sincere and humble request from passengers please change your staff or train your staff but please don't trouble the passenger ENTIRE NIGHT SPENT ON AIRPORT, CHANGED GATE 7 TIMES. Cancelled the flight after making us wait for 7 (till 3 am  hours whereas people who had not checked in were informed at 10 only and told to come for morning flight/we were subsequently shifted to the morning flight at 5.10, which took off at 8. Third rate airline with third rate staff. Infants and old people were really suffering - book at your peril"
43,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground support - good Lounge - good Boarding - bit messy (mainly because some people do not follow boarding instructions Welcome - friendly Seats - 2-2 , no flat bed, limited recline, less leg space (well, I am 183 cm), no in-seat entertainment Service - good ( excellent work) Recommend - not really"
44,"Not Verified | Ground staff - fantastic (managed by DNATA) Lounge - no (under renovation). Voucher provided for F&B outlets but not honored by any of the outlets. Boarding - normal. No hassle Welcome - warm and friendly Seat - 1F Pro - flat bed, TUMI amenity bag, slippers, sleepwear, Cons - poor condition of seats ( maintenance) damaged power sockets, Screen size comparable to economy class, poor selection of programs, no storage space in and around the seat, Food - good Staff - super efficient and friendly Lesson - new route doesn’t mean new aircraft!! Return - probably when the new aircraft’s are deployed"
45,✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst flight experiences in my history.  A 15 hour flight without In Flight entertainment. It is unimaginable in 2023. If the screen works the audio does not work and Vice versa. I pre booked my seats and they would sit us separately saying your flight is canceled and told us to sit where they allot us as if they are doing us a favor. There was no WiFi in the flight. 
46,"Not Verified |  Shame on Air India. Continuous 7 hours delay, Mumbai to Bangalore flight. At first it was scheduled at 17:55 & now to 22:40. Never ever i have experienced such poor service from any airline. Air India should learn from IndiGo, about customer loyalty & service's."
47,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline. Very poor flight management. Poor communication with passengers inside the airport. No body to take any responsibility, acting like children, only they are getting in a panic instead of being efficient. Please try to increase your on time, communication with passengers, give steady answers to passengers. Disappointed regarding flight AI573, 12/6/2023, flight has unconditional delay. Nobody knows why."
48,✅ Trip Verified |  The seats broken. Entertainment not working. The switch to call attendant not working. Food quality horrible. Booked food as Jain meal not provided as given to someone else. Wrong information given by crew for luggage belt.
49,"✅ Trip Verified |  As an Indian national, I can tell this is the worst flight experience I ever have. Seat front Tv was not working for the whole flight for all the way for 15 hrs flight, the Hostess were not friendly and maybe as a Indian they don't care about us because we already bought a ticket. Seats arm rests were all wobbly not fixed."
50,Not Verified | No proper response from any of the staff. Hiding all the information about flight timings. Flight got delayed for more than 5 hours. After entering into flight again a delay of one more hour for the staff to come. And the passengers with connecting international flight from Mumbai suffered a lot because of these delays. One sincere and humble request from passengers please change your staff or train your staff but please don't trouble the passengers
51,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was a flight that I had to take early morning due to the alternatives having much higher fares especially over weekends. The check in for the flight and the ground experience was quite good and even the flight boarding started on time for what seemed to be like a 90-95% full flight. The staff at check-in offered me seat 4F at the front that had no other seats in front of them which resulted in extra legroom. Pushback started on time and once airborne the breakfast service commenced and I had opted for the non veg course that consisted of an omlette, chicken sausage with spinach and hash browns. along with a croissant and yoghurt. The meal itself was pretty good. However one thing that I had noticed which was not appreciated was the fact that the tray table was not properly cleaned. The landing happened on time and I had no difficulty in getting my luggage. Overall for the price that was paid, this was actually a very good flight. Thanks to the crew and team."
52,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience ever. Staff don't even know how to talk to passengers. Never going to fly air India again. Air India is a waste of money, flights get delayed, worst experience ever."
53,Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Coordination between ground staff and cabin staff is zero. My flight was planned to departure at 2215hrs right now im sitting inside the flight for almost one hour and did not even got a cup of water. Keep Air India as your last option. 
54,"Not Verified |  Check at Newark airport was good not issues but in plane in entertainment system was broken even usb charges were also broken actually most of them broken on plane seats were uncomfortable and broken. Staff was courteus. I had requested a wheel chair but at Mumbai Airport there were multiple wheel chair operators they told me stay asked somebody will take you shortly but nobody took me finally they told me please go up to the immigration counter somebody will be there to help you but nobody was there again. I was told to walk up to ramp to pick up your luggage, you will get wheel chair there again no body helped me there either since I have some health issues hardly I could pick up luggage and took it up to security by doing this I hurt my shoulder and back I was told to take up my luggage up to domestic terminal that was far away it’s really very poor service provided by Air India"
55,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight from Toronto Was delayed by 13 hours - luckily we were informed by sms before hand. The flight was to leave from Toronto on 6th June at 1 a.m. When I went to business lounge on airport at 10:30 after security, they told us that the food counter will close in 10 min. and the lounge will close at 11 p.m. I asked them, what am I supposed to do till the gates are open, they said sit at the gate we can't help. Is this right? Am I not entitled for any compensation when my flight got delayed by 13 hrs? On 19th May 2023, I took a flight from DEL to YYZ, with my wife, 80% of the monitors in economy, business as well as first class were not working (flight time 15 hrs). Some seats were not reclining! We were in Business Class"
56,"Not Verified |  We 3 people (2 adults and 1 child) were travelling from London to Kochi via Delhi. We missed the flight 4am) from Delhi to Kochi because of our child was continuously vomiting and it was early morning 4am flight. But we reached airport little late (4:10am) they failed to arrange alternate flight for us and they told us to book new seats. They said you will get email after some time, as PNR is generated no issue. We trusted them and returned back to hotel. We didn't receive the email at all and we contacted the costumer service they also said its okay just go to airport and get the boarding pass. We went to airport little early (2am) with all our luggage, and child. When we arrived they said that in your name no seats book and all seats are full we cannot help you. We showed PNR number, they said but as you didn't get email we cant do anything. We went to manager of the Air India, she didn't show any interest in helping or solving the issue. We checked with other airlines. They had 2 seats, one seat like that so we had to book new tickets again with Vistara next day morning (3am) and we returned back to hotel again with all our bags (25kg bags, hand luggage) and child. Horrible service by Air India. Horrible staff members and irresponsible, non cooperative. They were all laughing making fun of each other and customers, no seriousness and no helping nature. It all happened in Delhi international airport. As we were confused and standing what to do, we were just observing them, they are so careless even for old people who are approaching them and they don't know the language Hindi or English. They are very careless they are not there for helping others they are not serious about their job. "
57,"✅ Trip Verified |  I boarded a flight from JFK to BOM on Monday, May 1st. The flight was scheduled to take off at 10:45 AM but was delayed until 5:20 PM (nearly 7 hours). Everyone had to deplane. Air India only provided each of us a $15 meal voucher for the long delay. On my way back to JFK from New Delhi on Thursday, May 18th at 2:20 AM, I asked an Air India check-in rep if he could upgrade me to business class. He said no because all the seats have already been taken. When I boarded and got off that flight, I saw that wasn't the case. I decided to submit a case on the Air India website and then was prompted to email [email protected]. I sent them an explanation on Friday, May 19th detailing all the inconvenience that was caused. Surprisingly, they replied to my email on the same day saying that they have ""shared details with the concerned airport"" and once they receive a response, they will get back to me.  I never received a response from them ever again. I requested a follow-up on May 29th, May 30th, and finally June 6th via email. I also called Air India on June 6th, but the rep kept asking me for my ticket number. I informed him that I've already flown and do not remember my ticket number. I asked him how I can find out this number. He didn't provide any assistance. Instead, he only repeated himself and decided to hang up. Very frustrating. I am appalled by the customer support team's lack of urgency and horrible service."
58,"Not Verified |  How bad airline service can be? We got a text message at 630 am today (June 5th) saying our flight for June 6th from JFK is delayed and all other connecting flights are moved as well - resulting in 24 hour delay. Email was sent with just two options - accept or cancel! So, called Orbitz (another useless service provider), they booked our flight to JFK-Mumbai - MAA and sent confirmation email etc all good. Then in 2 hours, we check, our tickets were cancelled.- including original booking! called Air India, nohelp - blamed Orbitz.. called Orbitz, same process again, rebooked, showed up in Air india, after 2 hours.. magic, ticket disappeared.  Air India - no help total failure to take care of customers and causing anxiety -- 24 hours before start of important trip.. will never book in AI ever again. "
59,"✅ Trip Verified |  I did not like the plane's interior quality and how it was maintained. The plane was so old that the seats and infotainment systems were broken. People were literally trying to change seats to watch something in the screens. The most ridiculous part of all is that a manual in airlines said to not remove shoes. The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience. I don't know if these reviews are heard and seen by this airline to improve their service, but my experience travelling with them was the worst of all the airlines I have travelled with. I hope the review is heard and service is improved to make an impression."
60,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a 3 connecting flights from air India confirmed. In Gatwick airport at the time of check-in air India staff said i will get my bags direct in Kolkata last stop. But when i asked the crew member they said i will get it from Goa. Another part had a 9.40 hours continuous flight from Gatwick to Goa there were no charging points working, all were broken.  When asked for assistance to crew members they were like ""I am sorry"". Seats were full of debris, window mirror was not wiped there were stains on it. Avoid booking Air India. Made a big mistake. After coming down to Goa airport there was a layover for about 5 hours and after standing in a cue for 1.5 hours for check in again the staff said you have to wait for ""30 minutes more"". Like seriously there is no one to manage customers. No managers. No seating arrangements. Had yo wait standing in front of counter and then again had to wait in cue for 3 hours for check in."
61,"Not Verified |  I took Air India for a G20 meeting as an official. The major disappointments are old planes with no inflight entertainment, and incompetent and rude ground services. I would give the credits to cabin crews who tried their best to be helpful though. Check in staffs need to be better informed on visa requirements, so not to annoy customers with proper requirements waiting. India's chaotic airport security is already a nightmare, but a ground staff in Delhi made it worse. In my experience, airport security staffs made a horrible mistake of not stamping my boarding pass. And an Air India staff at the boarding gate was very rude as if I was someone with a security risk. He made me wait to board the plane last without a proper explanation, to a point that a security lady was nice enough to give a calming gesture and signalling the boarding staff is rather a rude one."
62,✅ Trip Verified | One of the worst airlines. Rude employees. My flight was canceled and the refund is still not processed. Upon calling the relevant people there is no proper communication instead they hung up the phone saying I don’t know.
63,"Not Verified |  The flight is the same in which I traveled to Chennai 1 month prior. There is no difference between domestic and international flight. No screens, seats also ok, does not give any international feel. The meal served was very much less in quantity. Just 2 spoons of rice mixed with Manchurian. Along with that curd was been given which was no where a combination. The meal was horrible. Many of them received veg though they had choose non veg. Very disappointing."
64,"Not Verified | The worst and irresponsible airline I have ever seen or had. My friend and I had a ticket of Air India from Vancouver to Delhi on May 21st. The flight had delay for 14 hours and finally they canceled that. They don't care about people, infants and elderly people at all. A very irresponsible and unorganized airline. I don't suggest this airline to anyone."
65,"✅ Trip Verified | Pathetic experience as the seats were not clean, no screens were working in the row E, the food was not tasty, half of the cuisine was made with corns only. Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment. Air India needs to improve a lot on their quality."
66,✅ Trip Verified |  I am really disappointed with international travel with Air India from London Heathrow to Delhi. there is no any improvement in flight comfort. Every time their video display are not working and very rarely its starts all of sudden and again stop working in between. No provision of headphones. Seats are not at all hygienic and not kept clean. Restrooms cleanliness not maintained its too unhygienic.
67,"Not Verified |  No Inflight Entertainment. When I asked the staff regarding this they clearly said that the airline knew about this and they have taken the aircraft from the Hangar and deployed it. The journey was 12 hours and with no in flight entertainment, it was a nightmare. The return journey from Delhi to Melbourne was the same if not worse. No7 Inflight entertainment again, No reclining seats. With my ticket purchase I paid to have the In flight entertainment as a part of what this airline advertised. This is False advertising"
68,✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was on time took my seat and relaxed with a glass of champagne. Announcement was made we have a tech issue and power was turned off. After approx 20min had to deboard then after 5hrs waiting in the gate lounge they announced that the flight was cancelled. Another hour waiting I was finally rebooked onto Emirates and sent to a hotel for a few hours (all played for by IA). So disappointed that I never got to fly.
69,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to San Francisco and the flight was so horrible. First time I was traveling by Air India and I will not recommend anyone to travel by Air India. The seat is so tight space (not comfortable), the entertainment system was broke down in the entire flight (almost 17hrs non stop journey). I ordered Muslim food when I booked the ticket but on the plane during my journey I was not given the Muslim/halal food. The food I was given was not eatable.  I will never travel by Air India and not recommend anyone to travel also by AI."
70,My flight was scheduled rom Amritsar to Delhi and from Delhi to New York. The flight was delayed to the point that  every passenger missed their connecting flights. On top of this i had another flight from New York to Vancouver the next day which I missed and had a book a new flight for 400$. I talked to the airline staff and they said that the flight to Vancouver is not with their airline so they couldn't provide me any compensation. They didn't even care to look for any other flights from Amritsar to Delhi to help the passengers catch their connecting flights. Such a bad experience that I'll never travel with this airline in future no matter what. e.
71,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely primitive aircraft, None of the on-Board Audio systems work. You've to look at the sky or blank screen to spend time. Crew and their services were good, helpful. However, they can't fix everything on broken Aircrafts. Ticket prices are not any way cheaper than competitors flying to Kolkata. Except the Middle Seats in the Economy sections, one has to pay to get windows or aisle seats. It's not cheap, costs CAD 61.90. The aircraft quality must improve."
72,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time I am flying Air India after take over by Tata. There was a noticeable change in counter service at both Chennai and Bengaluru. Cabin crew in the flight were warm and food was top class. Area where attention is required is toilet upkeep during the flight, and the seat comfort"
73,"✅ Trip Verified |  The service on this flight was better than the last time I flew. Usually the staff are really rude, but on this flight it was alright especially Mohammed in the cabin was good. This time the tv was working unlike most of the times it's not working. For a 9hr flight it's really boring"
74,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to Delhi and back and the service was very poor. I have flown other airlines and they were so much more nicer. Return trip was a nightmare and was more than an hour late and the seats and toilets not cleaned. No hot towels were given either. The female attendant was more keen on jumping around and not serving!
75,Not Verified |  Bad food (especially London to Delhi sector). Entertainment not working on one side of the plane London to Delhi. Staff new and not efficient - taking too much time to serve even though flight running half capacity.
76,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had very pathetic & unpleasant experience flying with Air India. In flight experience was really bad. Aircraft was really old. Seats were unserviceable, handle & foot rest were broken and adjusted with Tapes. Seat covers were torn. Food Quality was really really bad. Flight entertainment system was also not working. I will never travel again with Air India and will not recommend to anyone to waste money."
77,"✅ Trip Verified |  My comment is mainly for safety concern. I was allotted seat at emergency exit row, along with me in same row one was senior citizen and one was obese. I have request that emergency exit seats to be allocated to passengers which can actually help in evacuation in case of emergency. Please look into the issue for future flights considering safety of passengers"
78,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely disappointed to fly with Air India. From the first step in, it was shocking. The odour in the aircraft, no in-flight entertainment on a 13 hours flight, no proper information provided by the crew due to lack of knowledge, the condition of the physical aircraft interior, cleanliness, everything was poor."
79,"✅ Trip Verified |  Would never fly again. Didn't have a working screen for the whole flight and wasn't the only one on board who didn't, 2 of the 3 screens in the row were broken. When I pressed the buzzer for assistance it went unanswered for 40 minutes and eventually had to get someone, despite crew resetting the screens they remained broken and they didn't offer any further assistance. My seat also didn't recline which was very uncomfortable for sleeping. The flights were not cheap. I contacted them about my complaints and received no answer so they clearly don't care about customer service. The food was good and the only positive thing I can say."
80,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on AI171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick on 20 th April and during beverages I asked cabin crew for two cans of beer, so was served. Later I asked for more Beer and cabin crew lady said you can have later. I waited two hours and I called and asked and she said I can't have beer. She was not friendly to customers.  Also TV screen was not working."
81,"Not Verified |  
Faced very bad experience in plane, no proper care by air hostess team. No proper bag allocation for passengers, we carried out luggage on our laps in our entire journey which made us very uncomfortable to sit for such long time. We wish we would never choose this airline again."
82,"Not Verified |  Have not travelled with this airline since 2016 but this time the crew and food was improved. We had 3 flights with them Cochin to Mumbai, Mumbai to Aurangabad return to Mumbai. "
83,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have read mixed reviews of this flight. But it was an excellent flight with top notch service.  It was a proper three course meal. The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.  I understand that because of 2-3-2 seating, there was privacy issue. "
84,"✅ Trip Verified |  For our 3 seats the entertainment units were not working, for my seat the headset was not working and I was told to just read the subtitles by the team member and that this would definitely keep me entertained! My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight. The entertainment units not working on a day flight was frustrating, however the team members words were infuriating for us. The bathrooms were a mess throughout the journey and the crew were not keen to tidy them up. service was slow but professional. Admittedly nervous about our journey back home next week."
85,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible customer service. Will choose to never fly with them again. The aircraft entry staff is predatory, will make demands on charging for carry on and laptop bag even when items bought are only from duty free and within reasonable amounts of weight. The flights are always overbooked and staff at the doors are unhelpful if any queries are raised."
86,"Not Verified |  Check in was smooth, website works, staff at counters were ok including those in Seoul. Food average. Domestic connections were ok and food served was hot.  Inflight announcements - poor audio quality, grammar and mistakes in announcement including time, does not look professional. Cabin heads were both male and generally invisible. Safety only on screen, only one out of pop down screens worked. In one case my inflatable was on the ground. Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers. Staff - good to average. Tokyo flight unresponsive and rude , opposite on my Seoul flight. Interiors worn out in both flights, lumbar support lacking and worn out seats thin reminded me of cheap domestic flights. "
87,"Not Verified | Flew business class in Feb to New Delhi and back in March from Delhi to Vancouver. Aircraft is old and the seats didn't work. All broken. No TV's and the food was bad, expected a better service when flying business class. Can't imagine what economy would be. Bathroom were dirty, no soap or napkins. It seems like they don't really care knowing that People like to fly direct and they are the only option. Will not fly Air India again. Overhead bins were opening during turbulence. Felt very unsafe. On another note, staff did try their best and were very polite."
88,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard."
89,✅ Trip Verified |  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional. Never flying Air India again.
90,"Not Verified | My flight was from Milan to Hyderabad and it was horrible with the baggage policy. I had to collect my baggage in Delhi and again re check-in in Delhi, there was a delay in flight too. I was told I can collect my luggage at Hyderabad but Air India failed to do so. This is unfair and bad service."
91,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew Air India on March 31st. Ground crew at Vancouver she is very nice and friendly. However the aircraft is too old. Seat armrests are broken and entertainment are not working. I could not even charge our devices. But the flight attendants specifically Chodden and Anisha are friendly, they made sure that our kids were entertained while on flight. I don't think we will be flying Air India in our future travel."
92,Not Verified |  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline. They simply said we cannot help you. 
93,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rusty old broken aircraft. Ground staff at Vancouver airport misguided me for not upgrading my flight to business so unable to upgrade my tickets and suffered a flight in economy class. Booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst. Broken arms broken entertainment system. Nothing was working at all. For 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blank’s screen. Very very poor aircraft, rusty or cushions broken seats, useless entertainment systems.Even though business and economy seats were vacant the crew were not able to provide us alternatives which is a shame. I will never ever travel again on Air India flights and would never recommend anyone using it."
94,✅ Trip Verified |  I first travelled in May 2022 and had return flight Aug 20th 2022. As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show? Literally there’s no other answer they have which is clearly they are lying and basically scammed me for such a huge amount?
95,"Not Verified |  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip)."
96,✅ Trip Verified |  Service is good. Flight was on time but it’s always a case nowadays it takes almost an hour for baggage to reach the belt. Baggage service to be improved.
97,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Kolkata, which was supposed to depart at 6.40 am was delayed due to technical difficulties till 11.30. All passengers, myself included, missed their connecting flights and the airline in no way gave even a shred of consideration for something that is entirely their fault. Extremely disgusted by Air India and will never fly it again. Recommend all to find other airlines which will actually reach you to your destination."
98,"Not Verified | Here is my experience onboard Air India's Boeing 787-8. The airline does not have a good reputation as of now unlike its glorious past. On entering the cabin and reaching my seat, I found the cabin to be a little unclean. But the seat was good. But the best part yet about Air India was their amazing legroom. It was so much, that I kind of got a feeling of sitting in Premium Economy (without the Premium Economy service of course). The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good. What's the point of adding categories, when there is absolutely NO content in that particular category? Overall, apart from the entertainment system, the experience onboard Air India was quite good. I would gladly fly them if there are improvements in the IFE and cabin cleanliness."
99,"Not Verified |  I wish I can go with o stars. Flight was announced late of 2 hours and then another 3 hours unofficially. Sad thing is flight waited for cabin crew for an hour or so. The IFE screen does not work and no one knows where we are in air as maps also does not show on main display. Even family back home does not know exact ETA as airline is not providing exact information online. In Delhi, no one cares as other connecting flight is missing . Next flight is after 8 hours. I ended up in airport all night."
100,✅ Trip Verified |  Air India surprised me with the service for the price. Flight was clean and neat. They attached a tab for each seat with disposable headset to watch movies and free food that too with good taste.
101,"✅ Trip Verified |  We bumped up to first class for our 37th wedding anniversary. From beginning to end, on our 14+ hour flight to India, Air India did not disappoint. The entire cabin crew was very friendly and welcoming, including the pilots. Tenzen, our flight attendant was awesome in every way. She made us feel like family. We will definitely be using Air India on our future trips. See attached photos of our sweet anniversary note, cheese cake and champagne! They didn't have to do any of it. Very special memory indeed."
102,"Not Verified |  This airline is by far the worst I have ever flown with. No screens working, only one toilet from 4 working, no overhead lighting working. Awful food and the poorest drinks selection ever."
103,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst customer service. They don’t stick to their word. Our bags suppose to get delivered by March 15th 2023. When we requested at Hyderabad airport on March 14, they said - bags are coming in next flight and will directly ship your address. When called on Mar 15, they said - bags got delayed and coming in next flight. When called on Mar 16, they said - bags are coming in cargo. When called on Mar 17, they said - it is in Delhi, will be shipped to Hyderabad address.. When called on Mar 18, they said - bags are expected to deliver by March 18. I really want to understand - what service these guys are maintaining. If something happened during the journey (in our case delay in baggage) you will end up hours of time to following up with customer care. For sure it is not a good customer experience."
104,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with Air India for return flight on March 6th, 2023 from Delhi to Tokyo. I had an additional luggage for which they made me pay $400CAD for only one 23kg bag, which unacceptable. As my ticket says $100 per additional luggage and that's exactly what I paid when departed from Canada on Jan 15th, 2023. I showed them the ticket and reminded them about the fee and the agent at Delhi Airport was like you have to pay $400 CAD else you can leave your luggage or dispute the amount after your trip. There has to be a consistency what they say and what they issue on a ticket. I will not fly with Air India again, as neither their inflight service is good nor the charges they make us pay on time. Worst experience ever."
105,"Not Verified |  I flew recently from JFK to Delhi to CCU. The flight from JFK to Delhi is horrible. The flight has no charging place. Our TV screen was not working and many of our fellow passenger's. Food was terrible.  Flight has no wifi services. Seats and tray tables are broken. The flight has only two functioning bathrooms, rest of the bathrooms are closed, god knows what happened to those. Air hostesses are rude in their services."
106,"Not Verified |  I traveled on 28th January 2023 from Doha to New Delhi and my luggage was damaged despite fragile, heavy, priority and other mandatory stickers on it and this was the 2nd time. I decided to get my compensation and made a final settlement with the officer of lost and found department of Air India and was told that it would be received within 48 Hours and till the date it has not been received."

Excellent Service by all the crew especially Priti, Riya. The plane was clean and tidy. Amenities were from Tumi even the pajamas were from Tumi. Food variety and the way it was served was amazing. I don't consume alcohol soI don't know about that part but I appreciate the attitude of the crew, their willingness to see the comfort of all the passengers was top-notch."
108,"✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again."
109,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's a disgrace. No accountability or professionalism. After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this."
110,"✅ Trip Verified | Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable."
111,"✅ Trip Verified |  A total disgrace. Flight delayed overnight, nobody at the airport to assist or offer advice. Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do. Complete disgrace. Every time I fly this airline I regret it."
112,"Not Verified |  The flight was on-time, leg room was not bad, the in-flight stewardesses were attentive, check-in was efficient with the generous baggage allowance (one of the main reasons, I opted for Air India) and baggage was delivered promptly. However the aircraft was a tired and old A319 where the seats did not recline, the cushioning was worn and the food to put it mildly was atrocious. It was a short 1 hour flight and frankly food was not needed on such a short hop but better to give some peanuts and cookies or just a croissant instead of the slimy, tasteless sandwich which was offered."
113,"Not Verified |  Horrible service, the aircraft had a technical issue and no one informed the passengers about the fault. The flight is already an hour and a half delayed, the flight staff is utter useless and disrespectful. No courtesy to provide water or even inform the passengers about the timeframe."
114,✅ Trip Verified |  I was very disappointed that none of the screens on inbound and outbound flights were working ! I have difficulty sleeping on a flight so to pass 8 to 9 hours without in-flight entertainment is next to impossible. The food is not that nice either.
115,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying with my friends, flight was packed. None of seat screen was working, no one listening to say sorry about this. When food was serving, staff were asking all what would you like have Veg or Non veg? As all says Veg food and end of the seats 10 people didn’t get any food as they were all vegetarian and vegetarian food not available as they given to all. It supposed to person who has book vegetarian food should have first priority not the last. In return on 1 March, same issue. Even when they serve the food, tea cup was dirty.  Service gone so down - very poor when they charge a lot. Not worth money to spend on Air India."
116,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight out on time Good service. Seat OK. Screen not working. Food reasonable. Return flight changed 1 day before (text and phonecall) Actually to a better time but on the day 50min delay at least 30min of which was standing in a corridor. Seat was creaky and uncomfortable. Food was below average quality. Service was polite and efficient. Overall I would only go Air India if the price was good which to be fair it was, but I would probably pay a bit more for a better experience if available."
117,"✅ Trip Verified |  My seats were changed as it was termed ""unserviceable"" on both sectors (New York to Delhi on Jan 27 2023 and Delhi to New York on March 1 2023) - the explanation given was shallow. The fleet is old, seats are shaky and the cushions are dirty. The restroom was smelly and not cleaned regularly, headphone given was not working (just one side worked). It is my first experience traveling Air India Business class on a long haul flight and the experience is not worth remembering. Not a good value for money considering the tickets are so expensive."
118,"Not Verified |  The inflight entertainment was broken. The crew don't provide water or beverages and did not answer any call button. Food was ok, but served only 2 times in a 16 hour flight with no snacks, water in between. I later saw the staff had kept one water bottle in the back of plane for anyone to drink from. The staff also needs to get better in respecting customers and being professional. Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference! Ground service made us wait in a long queue (SFO) -- don't know why they were so slow in clearing! I clicked recommend Air India as I am keeping my fingers crossed and hope this Airline gets it right in future."
119,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on Feb 15th from Newark to Mumbai AI144. Traveling along with me was my 15 yr. son. To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid. "
120,"✅ Trip Verified | After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved."
121,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very pathetic service, second time  9pm flight delayed, we're still at Mumbai Airport and clueless on what is happening. No water no food. Air India At its lowest. Same experience on 15th Feb morning 5am flight."
122,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed 8 hours in total, and staff were clueless when it comes to basic communication, informing passengers about flight details and helping people reschedule. Was a total joke and never flying Air India again. "
123,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had an extremely bad experience with Air India international travel! Cabin crew were extremely rude. They literally barked at us to remove our baby from the bassinet. We wanted to be a good samaritan and collected and bagged all the trash we generated and left the bag in front of the seat for them to clear. The air hostess serving our aisle came and shouted at us to go and keep the trash bag at the back of the plane. She was extremely rude and borderline misbehaved with us. Seats were dirty, no blankets were provided and they rarely offered water. Food was also not sufficient and there was a stretch of 6 hrs where no food was provided ( this happened in the flight both ways). Finally our luggage was misplaced and was returned after 3-4 days. The tickets are in the same price range as other airlines and such poor service is totally unexpected! Don’t have the option to give zero star hence had to give 1."
124,"Not Verified |  Recently travelled with my 2 months baby and old-age mom and had very unexpected and unhappy experience with the flight attendant. Because I was having my 2 months old baby and my mother's height was not enough to reach the baggage area, I asked the flight attendant to help with my cabin bag to put in the above storage. She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help. Forget about humanity, at least they should do their own duty with some basic honesty. I hope no one will have such a bad experience that we had! Have a safe and happy travel."
125,"Not Verified |  First time travelled with Air India. The entertainment system did not work for 14 hr flight. When asked was not answered properly. The food tray was dirty. Surprisingly i was ignored twice while serving food, and had to ask again and again. They only serve you 210 ml water glass twice in the flight. No water bottles. The seat was broken and the whole flight i was uncomfortable. There was no soap in the washroom. I paid extra for aisle seat and got a broken chair to sit on for 14 hrs. A big no for Air India"
126,"Not Verified | The worst airline I have traveled with so far! Long delays are just norm for this airline. Very old planes, broken entertainment system. Least help from ground crew. Super unorganized check-in process"
127,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had a confirmed business class seat in Air india from Delhi to NY , but when I reached the counter they had cancelled my booking since I had not checked in online. After much argument they tried putting me on a next day flight to Chicago, with in hotel to stay nor any transport. Said no to that and then finally the manager said she would get me on a seat the next day, while looking into that she said one seat had become vacant since a passenger had dropped out, finally after 2.5 hrs, got a boarding pass, only to find that the flight had 7 empty seats. On the flight after a small snack, no food was served for the next thirteen hours, since I was hungry asked for a sandwich. The movies were pathetic, the sound was horrible and the toilets were deplorable. Never again am I flying Air India. Horrible experience."
128,"✅ Trip Verified | Now I understand why this flight cost was so much cheaper than any other airline flying to Australia. First flight from Tel Aviv to Delhi was completely doable, no complaints there. The 12-hour flight however to Melbourne. Where do I start? I especially asked the check-in personnel that I wanted an aisle seat and confirmed with him twice, well you guessed right: I was stuck between two people for 12 hours in the most uncomfortable seat ever that would've required me to get up and stretch just about every hour. Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely! More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear. Crew looked overworked and annoyed with everyone - I left the best one last: the in-flight entertainment didn't work for like half the aircraft, including me if me course. They ""tried"" restarting the whole system but it didn't work. Also, the reading lights didn't work. Just sit in the dark, bored out of your face for 12 hours, you're welcome dear passenger. This is surely not tailored for a Western traveller, do avoid at all costs and pay the extra 500 dollars, it's worth it."
129,"✅ Trip Verified |  Disrespectful and rude cabin crew and that too in an international flight. They never respond to service call buttons. After not getting a response for an hour after pressing the call button, I asked a flight attendant passing by about my query. She instead charged me by saying  ""Mam why are you pressing the call button so many times, it is so annoying"" in a very rude tone, when I was not even the one who pressed it. Many passengers had pressed the call button and they didn't respond to anyone. Instead they were irritated on asking questions and acted like they were doing a favour by answering.."
130,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a frequent flyer member of Air India. The login and password never works to check your point you have got while travelling and no support if you call them. On 20/02/2023, I did online checking to fly from Sydney to Delhi so we have just baggage drop process only. To my surprise I had to wait for longer time than people who did not do check on line as there were more counter for people who did not do the on line so it was a big failure on part of Air India. I was given a seat on 37 J , Again to my surprise that row have no window to look outside and I found out the entertainment system in my seat was not working."
131,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very cheap seats and old, it’s like sitting on a metal seat more than anything. The tv’s don’t work.  The food was terrible and breakfast was horrendous. However, you do have a staff that try their best even if the company itself isn’t doing anything about these issues. Seats were very uncomfortable. Never travelling again with Air India."
132,"Not Verified |  Very uncooperative airline, not helpful, delayed 6 hours from Delhi to Mumbai. Then I missed my second flight. I'm begging these guys to reimburse my ticket but no one helped me. Not even single employee helped me. No one even worked on my complaint"
133,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight, no aircon working, no staff service. I press so many time to call button for water or any service but no one come. My first and last experience with Air India, such a bad flight and experience."
134,"Not Verified |  I’m very disappointed with the service Of Air India which was very poor. I asked air hostess multiple times to get me a water but after 2 hours i got very upset and told air hostess that i paid 3000$ per ticket and you guys are not even listening to our requests. After two hours i got water. So disappointing. Apart from service, the screens are not working and the food quality is not good enough."
135,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delay on top of delay, with no clear cut information given on when the flight will take off. Its already been delayed by 5 hours from Mumbai to Delhi and the ground staff still has no idea when it will finally take off. Air India have a fleet of aircraft but don't care about people and think its ok to have no accountability and behave callously."
136,"✅ Trip Verified | We have so much love and respect Tata and hence chose this air-line. They cancel international flights (AI144 from EWR to BLR for Feb 17th, 2023) with less than 21 hours in-advance of the scheduled departure. This has turned my world and plans upside down. Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company. I do not recommend this airline to anyone for contingent travel needs."
137,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had connecting flight with Air India from Delhi to Kathmandu. I had a worst experience with check-in officers, they didn’t give us boarding pass showing unnecessary reasons about baggage that we had checked in at Chicago airport. They were asking for extra Money (15$ Usd) for luggage which we checked in for baby. They also asked for our vaccination card which they didn’t even see, they were just trying to check if we have that or not. They were not checking vaccination cards for other passengers though. I was with baby travelled for 16 hours, I was unable to feed my baby in transit. "
138,"✅ Trip Verified |  I traveled with my 2 kids. The older one is 3-years old and younger one is 1 year old. We have requested a basinet seat and they told us that you should request it at the check-in counter so they can give it to you. When we went to the airport for check-in, we came to know that our flight was 4 hours late and they said basinet seat is not available. Everything was okay for us other than not informing us for flight was late. When we asked them about our next flight connection, they had no answer about it. When we reached Delhi, we came to know that our next flight was the next morning. As I had 2 kids with me i asked them to provide accommodation but they refused to provide any accommodation. It was a horrible experience for us that they are not happy to understand the situation of their customer.  Customer service desk people are hopeless, they are not happy to listen anything as it is our problem that our air India flight was late. Never travel with this airline. They are hopeless."
139,Not Verified |  Air India flight is delayed for 12 hrs. No one was responding about the expected time. They simply showing please wait. And the staff was very arrogant and not even responding for customer queries about the delay. Most of the people checked in to airport @ around 6AM and waited till evening 8PM. Flight started after 8PM. Worst behavior from the staff and no one available for most of the time at the air India service help desk for proper information about expected time
140,✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed with the service. Every time I have travelled with this airline it has never been on time. Always delayed. Ground staff not very helpful.
141,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denied boarding AI0489 Delhi to Surat Air India removed us from our flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent, the next flight is 24 hours later.  I could have made it on an Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. A pathetic staff was so rude to us yelling at us and said we have to take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable. Did they think we were going to be happy they put us in a hotel that's like a jail cell with no windows. A dump. Disgusting airline and pathetic after service. No responsibility. No accountability. No explanations given. "
142,"✅ Trip Verified |  I chose to fly Air India because of its Star Alliance affiliation and the fact that its prices are reasonable. In general, I was quite pleased with the flight. The business class section on Air India's international flights is getting a bit long in the tooth. The colors of beige and light red make it appear somewhat tatty. I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping. I kept sliding downwards and had to constantly adjust my feet.  There is a wide selection of food choices and I enjoyed my choice. The service is good with lots of attention throughout the flight. The entertainment services pale in comparison to other international airlines. Only a few movies are offered. I would not hesitate to fly Air India again."
143,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible experience, incompetent and rude personal, outdated systems, old planes with half of TV on long flights not working. There is no choice at meals you get what you get. Pricier than middle east airlines and yet offer far less service. Just wouldn't recommend to anybody, never flying with them for sure."
144,"✅ Trip Verified |  The food served was very bad and substandard, and needs improvement. The ground staff was okay but needs improvement. The airline staff was supportive."
145,✅ Trip Verified | This is my first flight with Air India and it was very poor services. 1) I order veg food and someone came and said we are short with veg so we can give chicken only 2) It’s a long journey and my screen is not working for the whole flight 3) I press attendant button as I need water but no one came for approx 30 minutes then I went to get some water. 4) The hand rest is also broken it’s totally uncomfortable fight and experience for me. I won’t prefer to travel with Air India in future due to the poor services and management.
146,"✅ Trip Verified |  A domestic flight which uses  Boeing 777-300ER . Boarding was smooth, separate for business and economy class. Seats were in 3x3x3 configuration, comfortable seats, good food, courteous cabin crew. IFE wasn’t working, they should look into it. And ticket price was at par any other flight operating same day."
147,✅ Trip Verified |  We are fly to Delhi with family. When we reached airport on time they tell that the flight is late 15 hours. They say come back 12.00 night. Technically our flight morning 10 am. They check in our luggage. After they did not have any voucher where you stay. They did not give any food voucher. We pay our food. Pay for hotel to stay. They did not say apologies or compensation. We call customer service few times and they say we can not do anything. In the future we will not fly this airline.
148,✅ Trip Verified |  I have not used Air India for last 30 years due to bad experience that time. This Flight was ok and on time. But Plane condition was very poor but I am writing about bad quality of food offered. Food was just not for human consumption.
149,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight experience was not so good due to delays, due to heavy fog. It was A319 and leg room was better than other airlines with same aircraft. It was just an hour flight so no proper breakfast provided, only a sandwich with water, cabin crew were courteous."
150,"✅ Trip Verified |  You charge the same amount for business class flight for AI 380,/381 and AI383. However there is a big difference in the quality of service. On AI383 the seats barely incline, no entertainment system and horrible stale food. While AI381 is a very pleasant experience. Really don't understand. Wide body and narrow body aircraft is not an excuse. Please fix."
151,✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with my spouse on 9 January 2023 with my spouse in a 14 hr flight. At first they used are cabin baggage area for first aid that is ok. Secondly 1/4 of their screens were not working. Their food was equally bad.
152,✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled to India this month. Seats were poorly maintained in both sectors to and from AI 144 - from EWR to BOM ( Seat No 37 C) AI 191 - from BOM to EWR ( Seat No 39D) Seats : Broken / no USB connectors / no flight entertainment overall very bad experience. Food : For the money paid and for preselected option at the time of booking you are given what is available on flight. Pre selection of menu is just a namesake activity on the website.
153,"Not Verified |  Travelling by Air India has been the worst experience of my life, utterly disgusting. Change of date of flying on short notice and worst the message wasn't updated and showed the original date of flying, change of route, instead of my non stop flight, the airline changed with stop over. Delay of take off for more than 5 hrs and not even a single refreshment or water served while waiting more than 1 hr seated in aircraft. No updates of time of take off."
154,✅ Trip Verified |  Never take this cheep flight from SFO. This flight is always delayed and you will miss the transit and end up staying longer. I stayed 2 hours inside seated. Customer service is very rude. They will not work with you to change the transit flight.
155,"Not Verified |  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions."
156,✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent experience on board. Aircraft seating was very comfortable and staff was friendly and efficient. Special mention of Ms. Sohoni and Ms. Mishra.
157,"✅ Trip Verified |  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again."
158,✅ Trip Verified |  Air India is disgusting. They removed us from the flight and gave our seats to other people without our consent. They then think they are doing us a favour by booking us in a hotel and on the next flight which is a whole 24 hours later. The hotel is a dump. It's disgusting just like Air India service as a whole. I had a doctors appointment and operation booked and because of them I am stuck in Delhi. I could have made it on the Indigo flight but they refused to book for me. The staff was so rude to us saying take it or leave it. This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are.
159,"✅ Trip Verified | This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers. I have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months."
160,"✅ Trip Verified | This is our national carrier and unfortunately one of the worst and most unprofessional airlines. You’d never come across a staff smiling (ground or air), the crew are aging and consider themselves irreplaceable being in the Govt owned airline. Even now, when it has been taken over, check in was chaotic and unorganised, seats were wobbly, seat covers were like you’d avoid even touching, infotainment screen was broken, schedule was not followed. Sadly, I will pay 50% extra to a different airline but never fly on Air India unless there are no other options available. Pathetic service and they do not deserve any sympathy. "
161,✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent food on the Hyderabad to London leg but food on the return leg was just ordinary. Excellent cabin crew. Special mention needs to be made of Ms Padma who was so caring and helpful on both legs of the journey. The entertainment system was not working on either legs. Punctuality was excellent. Toilets were well maintained and the pilots were superb. It was a smooth take off and landing on both legs. I could sleep on both legs comfortably.
162,"✅ Trip Verified |  Food quality poor. Tv screen not working. When requested to the Purser for looking into this, it was a very casual answer. They rebooted but never worked. The answer was cannot do anything. But is it not airline responsibility to ensure all facilities are working. Airplane old, with dirty seats and covers."
163,✅ Trip Verified |  My bag did not come off the plane. There was no reason given. There has been no updates. There has been no feedback. I am on Day 2 without a bag in a foreign country. They haven't provided any compensation for me not having my medication or clothing. They had time for me to sign an indemnity but they couldn't care less what is happening to me without my bags. Most disgusting service and worst airline ever.
164,"Not Verified |  The Air India staff were friendly and helpful. My child left her toy in the aircraft and we realized this after we got off the airplane. When we mentioned about this to the Air India staff they were kind enough to help get the toy back to my child. We appreciate the kindness and the hospitality of the staff. special thanks to Vishna, Marsuk and Vyshna for going the extra mile to keep customers happy and make our trip experience pleasant."
165,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst experience with Air india. I want to tell everyone please avoid this airline. No good food, no good service. Simple don't fly with Air India. Tata sir you bought this airline please also hire well and train staff, people paying lot of money to buy tickets these days. Customer service even worst support system I ever talked, They just don’t care about you, they received your money and after customer service Don't even reply your emails for any inquiries."
166,"Not Verified |  This flight was appalling. The plane was filthy. None of the TVs worked and were disgusting. Stains were on the window. Seating lumbar didn’t work and the plane smelled as we boarded. At Delhi airport, Air India staff were disorganised and in some cases, rude. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Several people lost their luggage. I will never fly with them again."
167,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never getting into any plane with the name Air India. In-flight entertainment system was broken on 12 hours flight, water was leaking inside the plane, Seats were hard as concrete, toilets dirty, food was horrible and staff at New Delhi Airport were rude and arrogant. Many passengers have no respect to others personal space and would sit on someones seat and refuse to move. I faced the same problem on my return flight. Never using the airline again."
168,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life. I paid more than $1500 to get to India from the US even though there were flights for $900. The reason is that Air India had a non-stop flight from the US. I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away. The food was horrible, the seats were horrible and had very little room, non of the screens worked and, even worse, none of the outlets that are in planes for recharging your device worked. When I ran out of battery on my iPad I tried to read but the light did not work in my entire row. One of the worst experiences on multiple levels. please , if you want to protect your money, and your comfort, look for another airlines."
169,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst airline experience I've ever had. While flying from Sydney to Delhi, no gluten free food was available despite it being confirmed on the air ticket. While returning, only one of the three in flight entertainment systems were working in our row. That's 12.5 hours of staring at a screen that doesn't work with nothing else to do. This is also despite having paid close to $7000 for our flights. Complete waste of money - unlikely to ever fly with them again."
170,Not Verified |  Great food and customer service. The staff were very friendly. The food options and drink options were plenty. I had very limited time to catch flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad however staff helped a lot.
171,"✅ Trip Verified | I was booked on a waitlist flight from CCU to BOM this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising. I had resigned myself to not getting any seat on the flight as it was pretty full but then at the last moment the supervisor managed to print my boarding pass and I believed that I was actually going to fly onboard the flight. Or so I thought. After clearing the serpentine security line I rushed to the boarding gate hoping to catch my flight. And that is when a big surprise was up in store for me where it was revealed by the boarding gate agents that I would be unable to board as a regular pax had taken my place. This was pretty jarring, especially at the last moment. So I then had to make my way back to the check in desk to retrieve my luggage which had to be offloaded from the flight. The point here is why was the boarding pass issued to me when there was no guarantee that I would get a seat onboard the flight? If the staff had informed me that there are no seats I would have understood and resigned myself to that fact. Instead by printing my boarding pass it gave me a false sense of hope which was clearly not correct. The purpose of me writing this review is not to bash anyone but to highlight there there are certain aspects of waitlist bookings that should be handled better here. I may also have to reconsider going for waitlist bookings with the airline if this practice continues. And in this regard, Air India dropped the ball here big time. I hope that the airline takes the feedback onboard here regarding this."
172,"✅ Trip Verified | One of the outstanding services I have ever experienced, especially the excellent neatness. For the cost of my ticket, other airlines typically do not offer minimum of refreshments. However, with Air India, passengers had enough good meals, and I am thankful to the Air India staff for their outstanding hospitality. "
173,"✅ Trip Verified | Excellent flight, on time departure and arrival. The Inflight service was the best I have even received in my over 30 years of international travel. The food was- good, Alcohol was - ok, In flight entertainment-poor, Aircraft condition -very poor. The flight attendant went beyond his duty to serve and please passengers. Maybe it was because Tata had just purchased the airline."
174,"Not Verified |  Horrible airline. Broken TV, broken equipment at the seat, food is mediocre at best, seats were changed and downgraded without refund. I would not recommend this airline to anyone."
175,Not Verified |  Customer care and cabin crew are very rude and uncooperative. The ground staff gave a pre-booked seat of a passenger couple with a child to another passenger without a reason and then were being rude to them. The poor couple didn’t get a seat with a bassinet despite booking it 4 months in advance with a confirmed status. This is horrible and corrupt service. All I can say is this happens only in Air India.
176,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight ever, no entertainment system works, no phone charger, broken seats, even the flight announcement didn’t work. Imagine a emergency announcement not reaching to passengers."
177,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India, You most certainly have improved with your inflight cabin crew and your inflight F&B. I am truly impressed as previous experiences under it's previous owner was mostly bad. (But at least they used the B787 for SIN-BOM) 19/11, SIN-BOM, Airbus 320. 25/11, BOM-SIN, Airbus 320. Both flights were +- full. What baffled me was, why someone in Air India would deploy this aircraft configuration for an International ""long haul"" 5.5hrs flight with seats with no seat pocket? The back of the seat only has document holder. The cabin had no power supply, no USB port so at least have seat pockets that allow customers to place their power bank in the seat pocket while charging their gadget instead of having to place the power bank in-between one's groin region. My other AI domestic flights BOM-GOI and return, had seat pockets for a 90 minute flight. This could have been a 10/10 review."
178,"✅ Trip Verified |  This year, due to a family emergency, we needed to travel to India urgently and we reluctantly booked an Air India flight in economy due to the lack of other viable options. The check in staff at Melbourne were pleasant, helpful and efficient. We had to queue but the line kept moving. The ground staff member was cheerful and upbeat and really seemed to enjoy talking to people and took pride in his job. Our boarding was on time and orderly and our flight departed exactly on time. The highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew.  During the twelve hour flight, our cabin crew were absolutely delightful: They looked happy and we had a nice chat about the Indian wines being served on Air India during the bar service. They emanated a sense of warmth and caring. The professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced. We enjoyed the food very much also: Very nicely seasoned. We can see that the aircraft interiors are looking a little tired but we understand that a programme of refurbishment is underway."
179,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am quite disappointed with the Customer Care services of Air India as they have not been able to refund the amount that they have charged twice for a ticket which I had bought in August, 2022 despite number of assurances given in response to my e-mails and also numerous conversations with their Customer Care Executives and senior Team Leaders. Every time they assured that the money will be refunded within next seven days but this excuse has been repeated for about seven times till date but to no avail.  I have eventually decided to forget this amount and have decided not to remind them about it anymore, as they have tired me out. However, I do feel Air India needs to take some corrective measures to have a transparent and effective customer care set – up."
180,"✅ Trip Verified |  Received very nice service from Rajani during my journey from Delhi to  Canada on flight AI 187 Date 21 Nov, 2022. She is very co-operative and humble."
181,✅ Trip Verified | Worst flight I have even taken. The entertainment screens were not working. The seat was not reclining and the seat felt like I was siting on a plank. Did not get any good response from the air hostesses. Longest 14 hour flight for me till now. They didn’t have any blankets. The air hostess calling light were only lighting on top of the passenger seat panel but air hostess don’t have any clue that passenger is calling them. You have to talk to the pantry area to ask for help. The flight is not cheap but it didn’t have anything to comfort the passenger.
182,"✅ Trip Verified | The seats had sufficient legroom, but the cushioning was really bad. I felt pain after the first hour, even after I placed the neck pillow provided, it didn't help. The food was good, the toilets were clean, the stewards were not stingy on the drinks and snacks. The main reason I opted for this is because this is the only direct flight to Kochi and I thought I would be able to adjust for a 9hr flight, but I was proved wrong. The touch screen didn't work, the USB charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken. The steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one, I had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions, are you a foreign national, etc.. why do they care? We know we need to fill it, this is not the first time we are traveling to India! The only major change I find after Tata takeover is that the steward's uniform has changed from red to blue and the pilot has become chatty."
183,✅ Trip Verified |  Not sure where to start but one word that describes this airline is rubbish. Never going to fly with them again. Outward journey: The seats didn't recline and the entertainment system was hit-and-miss. The table tray was broken. No blankets were provided and the food quality was inadequate. Inward journey: The entertainment system didn't work at all even though the staff tried resetting it three times. The seats were broken and again the quality of food was inadequate. Shame that Air India considers itself to be a national carrier of India.
184,"✅ Trip Verified | I am US traveler and flying Air India past several years. After Tata Group take over my expectation was something to be change for better but extremely disappointed. No TV service on 23rd Oct 2022 flight also on the 9th of Nov returning flight. Broken chair handles and dining trays on the 9th of Nov returning flight. Toilets are out of service due to the leakage per airlines crew. Food quality was extremely poor. Asking water on the 23rd of Oct flight, one of the crew replied “I’m busy”"
185,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever. Seats were so uncomfortable that they had plastic part visible, had back pain for week after that flight, there was no cushioning at at all in the seats. Sreens not working, restrooms were smelly. Customer care is even worst, every time you call them, they will say someone will contact you in 24 hours. It has been more than a month no contact at all."
186,"✅ Trip Verified | We travelled from Delhi-Bangalore on 4th November 2022 for a holiday and had our return flight booked on 8th November 2022, in Business Class. Both ways we had the worst experiences regarding meals and baggage collection and transfer from aircraft to airport in Bangalore. Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it. We were lucky that all seats were not occupied in the Business class, that day, therefore, we could change our seats on our own."
187,Not Verified |  Very poor service. Food was pathetic with no variation for lunch or dinner. No water or drink or snacks. Most Tvs / entertainment systems not working. No blankets. Staff not visible and not responding to calls.
188,"✅ Trip Verified | I had found this fare which came at a discount and thought of considering it. The check in was done properly and the last time I travelled on the airline post the Tata takeover, they had reduced the meal service so was skeptical over what the meal service was going to be like on this flight because the last time I travelled, only a sandwich as provided. The boarding started on time however the pushback got delayed by 30 mins due to the congestion at Mumbai airport which is the norm. I was also pleased to note that the ground staff offered me an extra legroom seat which was greatly appreciated. For the breakfast service I was pleasantly surprised as they were offering full breakfasts with both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian fares whereas previously only vegetarian was offered. The cutleries stainless steel instead of plastic which was a great touch. For the vegetarian fayre, it consisted of idlis, poha, croissant as well as mango yogurt along with tea / coffee which was great. The arrival was delayed by 30 minutes. But overall this was great value for money as I had got an extra legroom seat, a full breakfast with steel cutleries and good staff and crew service. I will be flying the return leg soon and I'm confident of receiving similar service. So much appreciated."
189,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft condition is still not up to mark but cleanliness,inflight service and on time performance has improved. Our departure and arrival was on time, aircraft needed refurbishment but was clean, Air India have seats with maximum leg room with same class in India. Dinner served was good. Good experience and will continue flying with them."
190,Not Verified |  Had taken AI 186 in business class on 1st November with my wife and we had a very comfortable experience right from Check in. Flight took off in time and had good comfort and our seats were good and very courteous staff. Food was also OK for us and flight landed in Delhi one hour before the scheduled arrival time. Our connection flight to Kochi also left in time and and arrived also in time at Kochi. Overall we are very happy.
191,✅ Trip Verified |  My flight Dubai - Chennai was very comfortable in seat 2D. Of course the plane was very old. The safety announcements were antiquated. Entertainment systems were absent. And the seats had limited reclining. But the ticket was cheaper by 40% so I was happy to accept these shortcomings. And the plane was on time.  The 2 lady flight attendants were very attentive and empathetic. I had ordered a gluten free meal and they made sure I was comfortable with it. 
192,Not Verified |  I took air india in December 2021 and June 2022. On my return I wanted to claim the milage. Something went wrong and I couldn't access the flying return milage program. For last 5 months I have contacted air india staff in vain. Tons of back and forth emails and number of calls at customer service number. They keep passing me from person to person and asking for same document multiple times. I am fed up and frustrated following up with the AI staff and come to conclusion that they have a bunch of staff who do not care for their customers. One of the poorest customer service of an international company. What a pity. Be careful if you ever want to take Air India. There are options people and we deserve a better deal.
193,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very old aircraft. I got moved twice because the seat buttons were not working. The seats were very uncomfortable. The tv screen was hazy and unclear. Entertainment was limited to 5 English movies! The map route was not available and the vegetarian breakfast was disgusting. No flavor. The captain came on the speakers twice, at departure and arrival. Most announce the altitude and give a few details of how the route will be."
194,✅ Trip Verified |  Airport staff is not trained well. Everyone was giving me the different information. Do not know what is the next step. Taking hours for work should be done within minutes. Took double the amount of fee for one baggage. Trying to contact customer service and agents are saying they cannot do anything and I should speak to Delhi airport wow is that even possible. What are they working for?
195,✅ Trip Verified |  The seats are broken in business class and band aids were applied when shared with the air hostess. They should not be putting passengers on such unsafe seats where the handles are wobbly!
196,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seats were dirty, old worn out and rickety. Video screens not working. Staff were apologetic and helpless. It’s not worth the money at all. There are more airlines that give you better value for money. Such a sad experience. Don’t fly Air India."
197,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very poor experience. Only highlight was access to lounge at HTR airport which was Singapore Airlines lounge. Flight experience - seats are not as comfortable as one would expect in business class. Very old seats with poor cushion. seats in row 1 is very narrow. Flight entertainment did not work so made the flight very noisy. Food was not up to business class standard. Did not get wash bag when flying out, not sure why. Flight from Delhi to London - food was very poor. A menu was supplied only to be told that options on the menu not available. Food tasted poor quality and dry. Airport lounge at Delhi airport was not up to standard - food was limited choice, not enough provisions. I would give a zero rating for inflight entertainment and food if I had a choice."
198,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very well maintained. Cabin crews were  amicable and very customer friendly. They responded quite promptly to any problem we faced. From check in to onboard and inflight experience, all were perfectly balanced. Even during the huge turbulence the pilots were quite professional and handled the situation well. "
199,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a frequent flyer of AI. I m proud to share that my experience has been improving in recent times. The ground staff is courteous, helpful and cooperative. The quality of food has improved and the variety introduced is amazing. In fact this particular route which I flew, i reached before time. Strongly recommend"
200,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight is the worst. Entertainment system is not working for 14 hours flight and they do Covid test for only American citizens They do discrimination after landing people at Indian airport are very rude “show me your boarding card in a very rude manner “. 
201,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seats were broken, the plane was not cleaned properly, trays broken and dirty around tray. Screens for a-lot of people not working. Plane very outdated when we have paid over £600 for ticket. Staff were good however."
202,"✅ Trip Verified |  Summaiya saw me standing, as I was almost 5 hours before the flight time. She was so kind and generous to me that she did my check in and helped me even. Her polite behavior was amazing and nice."
203,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked Air India after reading many negative reviews to see how bad it really was. Turned out to be a pretty smooth and comfortable flight. Quick & efficient check-in staff. Plane arrived early, we departed early and reach much before the scheduled arrival time. The cabin crew was courteous and professional. Snacks served were very basic but of good quality. Emphasis was made on covid safety protocols. Baggage reclaim was quick. Though the aircraft was 12.6 years old and did show some signs of ageing, the cabin was quite clean and in a good condition despite the years of wear. "
204,"✅ Trip Verified |  Both me and my husband travelled in business class on the 25th September. The flight was very comfortable. The air hostesses went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. We were provide with amenities including a night suit. The food was more than sufficient and extremely tasty. I will like to specially mention the cabin supervisor Kalpana and her team members Varsha, Preeti and Makarand. I have come across a lot of negative comments about Air India but honestly it was a great experience for us."
205,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outdated aircraft. The entertainment system's screen could barely be seen. A very laggy interface. (This was on either legs of the flight. BLR-MUM-LHR & the return leg) The company needs to immediately look to upgrade their high traffic/revenue routes for start. Selection of alcohol was pathetic. They're only offering cheap IMFL liquor Sula wine & Blenders Pride. Ballentine though part of selection, was over shortly. Professional staff, who know how to manage the odd unruly passenger or support the elderly. If AI has anything to be thankful for, it is their staff."
206,"✅ Trip Verified |  Service was very good. Some minor problems but bearable as the price was close 1000 usd cheaper. The arm rest falling apart, choices on TV had 7 categories but only movies and TV options were working About 4 seats were not functioning. They blocked off those seats and accommodated the passengers in other available seats Staff was very attentive. Will travel again"
207,"✅ Trip Verified |  Smooth experience, early morning flight from Delhi. Aircraft was almost empty, with capacity around 200 passengers of A321 it was having only 60 passengers. Requested by cabin crew to occupy emergency exit seat to fulfil the emergency protocol. Crew were courteous, flight was on time, seats of Air India economy is best of domestic carriers. They only served a sandwich, 
 even that was not required."
208,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flown on an early morning Mumbai to Delhi flight. Departed on time and so was arrival. Air India is the only domestic airline which offers 20kg baggage allowance whereas rest all offers 15kg. Seat pitch of Air India is better than any other domestic airline. Cabin was clean and fresh but due to mishandling and mismanagement by previous management the seats are bit old, new management needs to refurbish now. Served good breakfast on the way, Staff were courteous and good service on board."
209,✅ Trip Verified |  We had the worst experience flying with Air India. I was flying with my 12 year old son and I had hurt my knee and needed a wheel chair. The food was horrible on the flight. Tasteless food and our television set was not working. We were traveling 14 hours without a TV. The crew tried their level best to reset it but it just would not work. The ground staff at Delhi Airport was just horrible. They have a huge badge that says no tips but since he has to help me from international to Domestic and take my luggage from I decided I would pay him 1000 Rupees which I thought was a fair tip. But he started demanding more money and n dollars. His friends came there too asking what’s the matter.  He told me that he took me their short cuts so he has to share the money thru the official thru. Wow Air India. Your officers don’t get paid that they loot us? Finally he settled for 60$. Why when all other air line employee or for that matter Air India ground staff in the USA won’t demand money why in India do they literally take advantage of you? Shameless.
210,"✅ Trip Verified |  The airline has improved in terms of great customer service, a courteous cabin crew, and excellent food and beverages served. We were travelling with an infant and the cabin crew were helpful and checking with us and provided all the assistance."
211,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew economy to Delhi from Melbourne on Air India AI309 on 16 Sept 2022 in a Boeing 787-8. At check-in the staff wanted our vaccine certificate and Airseva app downloaded. This was not known whilst booking or was any email sent prior to the day of departure. This resulted in huge chaos at check-in as lot many didn’t know. The aircraft seats were torn, and dirty, and the handrest and other parts of the seat were held together with fraying masking tape. The cabin partitions and carpet were covered with grime. The flexible arm of the display wouldn’t stand up, and the wired remote was broken and temperamental. The Upma & Vada served for breakfast was undercooked and stale. The bread roll was cold and tough as a rubber pad. Food didn't get any better on the 12-hour flight. Snacks were meagre to non-existent. I have used public urinals, which are cleaner than the toilets on board. The in flight service and cleanliness on this route were much better before the change of ownership."
212,"Not Verified |  I have been a frequent flier in Air India being a government employee, took a sigh of relief when it got privatised, which meant that I no longer had the compulsion to fly the same. However, against my better judgement I booked a flight from Delhi - Madurai via Chennai on 18 Sep. Reached the airport about an hr and thirty mins early as I was already travelling from Jammu. But due to the overall rush at the entrance and que, reached the counter 55 MINS prior to departure, but to my horror I was refused a ticket as the ‘Wonderful Server of Air India’ didn’t take web checkin and I was supposedly too late for boarding. The same was the case with four more passengers on same flight and even on the request of so many passengers, no body triers to hear the problem or help. the Manager was rude to the hapless passengers."
213,"Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever experienced. The ground staff is very rude. And most of the time the In Flight Entertainment doesn't work. The call button in the flight doesn't work, it took me 20 minutes to call a flight attendant. The food is horrible. The seats are very unhygienic, the tray table is also very dirty. After arriving on the airport, it took 30 minutes just for the first bag to come, and when I received mine, it was a bit damaged from the side. Terrible airline, won't fly Air India again."
214,"✅ Trip Verified |  The fare was booked at a cheaper fare which was good. The check in process and the ground staff was also good. The boarding started on time. However my experience related to the food and catering has been the opposite. Seems Air India has dropped the ball with regards to the food on board. Previously before it got privatized, they used to provide a full breakfast with tea / coffee as part of it's morning service. This time when I traveled post the takeover, instead of the breakfast, all we got was a sandwich. No beverages at all. Air India's food and catering was always it's strong point even before it got privatized (along with seat pitch and baggage allowance). But it seems that the new ownership is interested in cutting costs and then marketing this as as some sort of ""innovation"" to the gullible flying public. There are so many other aspects of the airline that need to be improved. Instead what the owners have done is turned a strength into a weakness."
215,"Not Verified |  Worst flight I ever had. I paid money and they even did not provide basic needs. TV was there and it wasn't working, and you can understand how I feel that for a long flight. I asked cabin crews for few things and honestly speaking, restaurant staffs are way more better than them. They were too rude and I became really scared to ask even for a glass of water. Guys, please, we are spending too much money on this airline atleast provide what we deserve. Please do train your staff, please make sure things are working, it is a request."
216,✅ Trip Verified |  They are providing TV but not allowing to use us. In Air india on same day I was travelling in 2 flights in both meals were included but in both they gave us the same meal in which they gave sandwich with a water bottle. This sandwich taste is very bad we ask them to give another food for which we were ready to pay but they had no other options. Leg space was also very small. There were no wifi connection.
217,Not Verified |  I travelled in January 2022 from Toronto to New Delhi. Airplane seat were very dirty. No tv screen was working. No maps monitor was working. Ticket price was very expensive. Totally poor service.
218,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rock hard seats (even in business), infotainment system worked thankfully, but the movies collection was very limited and from pre 2000 era. The interface was dated and buggy. Food quantity was limited with very poor presentation. I had an onward journey of 2 hours with Vistara on a domestic business, and that food quality/presentation was far better than this 14 hr Air India flight. Typical other issues as expected/noted with this flight. Seats were dirty, and you could see adhesive in various places. My seat stopped reclining mid-way and got stuck in a lie-flat position; I was then moved to another seat, which did not recline at all, and I was forced to be in a sitting position for the remainder journey. The washroom sink was choked towards the latter half of the flight. Feedback/complaint registered on Air India website, but as expected, there is no response (been over 15 days). The only positive of the airline was the cabin crew, who were courteous and polite. Flying economy of AC or one of the ME3 is a better choice than flying business with Air India!"
219,"Not Verified |  I was flying from New Delhi to San Francisco. The food was horrible. The chicken was bone dry,  green beans were raw at the center, the dish was very watery. The rice I was served was very dry and hard, the curry lacking any flavor. The seats didn't recline properly, and were as hard as a rock. The cabin crew was helpful, but unfortunately that's about as far as the positives go. I decided to not fly Air India again."
220,✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed with in flight entertainment. Mine did not work at all and getting through the long flight was a nightmare. The steward clearly told me that they cannot check each every unit and it is just my bad luck! I am already dreading my return flight after 15 days. Will Air India stay on my list of preferred airlines? Answer is no. Air India will certainly be my last option. Also. one of my bags also came back damaged!
221,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 27 Jun 2022. Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.  The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces. "
222,✅ Trip Verified |  Service quality was excellent. Food was good. Amenity kit is good. Seats were a bit old. Screen Remote was not working. Movie choices are few. Overall good flight.
223,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bhubaneshwar to Ahmedabad via Mumbai. Both aircraft used was A320. Staff were courteous, as it was snack time so only a sandwich with a sweet were provided, same for Mumbai Ahmedabad flight as it was less than an hour flight. At Bhubaneshwar after boarding there were some security reasons (and it was independence day of India) we were deboarded and again have to go through security and also through check of aircraft, this made the schedule delayed and we were on the verge of missing our connecting flight, we contacted commercial staff and they assured that they will try our best to get the connection. When we reached Mumbai it was already boarding time of our connection, just after disembarking we saw a staff who was waiting for us , he escorted till security, before security he changed our (only) boarding pass with a new one which was printed on business class so that we can go through business class security which was like a breeze. Actually we were the last one to board and they were waiting for us only."
224,✅ Trip Verified |  They didn’t give us seat belt for the Infant we are travelling with which is really not safe and there is only 1 cot seat for the whole economy class. It is very difficult to travel with infant on lap for 10 hrs. Very disappointed with Air India.
225,"✅ Trip Verified |  As with other Indian companies, we had problems with the web check-in, but the check-in was smooth (it was Independence day, and almost no one was flying). Everything else was fine. The cabin service was great, and the personnel nice. The price is that of a low cost with, but the service is much better. I would recommend."
226,"Not Verified |  The flight was old and everything in it showed ageing. The plastics were cracked, upholstery stained, cushions rock solid, paint peeling. The entertainment screen was not working and when asked the air hostess replied that it’s complaint in almost half of the flight. This happened on our way to and back. This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi. It was a nightmare for us, especially travelling with a child. What an embarrassment to Indians!"
227,"✅ Trip Verified |  
It was a relatively old aircraft. On take off, there was a slight vibration and the seats plastics showed some aging. Seats were comfortable. The washroom was clean and functional. The air stewards were efficient, polite and smart and caring.  Food was decent."
228,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Complete seat is not functioning, IFE is not working.  Unable to call the flight attendant and sleep the flight due to high glare from static screen that cant be turned off or operated. Food is cold and not able to eat. I complained to staff and also the flight supervisors, and they are aware of this issue, like the above issue is there for almost 20% of seats, they also have raised complaints to management but no response. they cant help as mid-flight."
229,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was smooth with no waiting time. Boarding was smooth. On board, interior has been refurbished, soft seats, good recline and clean cabin. Good quality catering service with choice of vegetarian and non vegetarian. Crew was attentive and was available to help. Magazines and newspaper were free. Food was almost till it is in stock. I am delighted to have great service from air India on domestic route."
230,Not Verified |  Lost/Delayed Luggage. Air India is worse flight ever I experienced. We all booked the flights with trust and conditions but this airline not obey any of responsibility towards customer and always something new happened.; This time my mother lost whole luggage which is they are not responsible they said we will send you home but even they don’t know where is a customers bad and staff is so bad and rude they are unable help for anything whatever you said they are blank we try to make a lot of calls which cost a lot overseas and staff said pls call Airport there is no one who help out and tell us truth . Please note it is not worth the risk of flying with them.
231,✅ Trip Verified |  I see this airline charging full service carrier and providing low budget airline facilities. Air plane interior was worn out. Seats were cranky and hard. Infotainment was not working except flight map. Lunch portion served was appears to be a child meal. Special meal request was not served. However crew were trying their best and flight arrived early even after a 1 hour delayed departure.
232,"✅ Trip Verified |  Travelling for the first and the last time on Air India. Delay by 11 hrs. from Vancouver to Delhi and return was 10 hrs delay. the inflight entertainment service does not work and you have no clue what to do for a 15 hrs journey, none of the screens work at all, the seats are dirty and broken, the tray table are broken. Ordered for Childs meal got Chinese meal, the beer is served warm with a glass of ice. On return journey the hotel provided in Delhi was a 1 star hotel with very poor rooms and service. "
233,✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst experience I had with this airline. I had an infant with me and they refused to issue the boarding pass saying that they need the visa. Where as in Saudi Arabia infants visa is issued on arrival. These guys refused to provide the boarding pass and I have to cancel my ticket and issue a new ticket from a other airlines who have given me the boarding pass unconditionally. They keep 3rd class people in there team who knows nothing but to trouble you and make you run.
234,Not Verified |  Awful! Worst experience I have ever had. Check in was challenging. I paid a large sum of money for business class. My seat buttons did not work. I had to sit upright the entire 15 hour flight. The only thing I got from flight attendants was “Sorry for the inconvenience.” No wifi. No entertainment. Worn out plane. A rip off! Never again!
235,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am warning others to not choose this airline even if the ticket prices are attractive. You want nothing to do with this type of service. I have been on the phone for a refund for a cancelled flight throughout the last 15 months (flight cancelled in May 2021 and its August 2022) and left numerous feedback forms on the website and all I receive are apology emails that inform me that they are processing the refund as soon as possible. Every last agent tells me they are escalating to some other department. Last contact from their ""ecommerce department"" was on 29 January 2022, after which nothing else. I have tried contacting them after that as well to no avail."
236,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience flying Air India. The plane from Mumbai to Newark was dilapidated and some of the seats were even broken (they were still assigned to customers). The in-flight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants seemed apathetic to pressing the request assistance button on the seats. The food was just OK. We had terrible experience checking in at the Mumbai airport. The airport manager was rude and would not let me check in my car seat for free which is the law in the US and demanded me to pay extra money for it. He would not listen to my argument that I got it to India for free and this was my return trip back to the US. Only later I showed him that the Air India website listed that car seats travel free that he allowed me to check the car seats for free. I would not recommend this airline to anyone till Air India retrains their staff in customer service and upgrades their airplanes.
237,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India should be ashamed for operating such a dilapidated and outdated aircraft for a 14-hour flight on this sector and charging a premium of almost CAD $2500.00 per ticket for a one-way flight. Their domestic aircrafts are in much better shape. There was a 8 hour delay to begin with. Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes. Would the top management of AI fly economy on such an aircraft on a 14 hour flight? The cabin crew were courteous but there was nothing much they could do with regards to the condition of the aircraft."
238,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience. Flight delayed for 15 hours from Delhi to Chicago. Food is very bad in International flight. No Entertainment. Most of the screens are not working. Alcohol served is very low quality. Not clean and Most of remotes doesn't work , and those are old like 1947. Never travel Air India."
239,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute worst airline and service. IFE did not work for most people on the flight, meals were terrible, cabin crew took at least 15 minutes to respond to calls at a time when they were not even busy. Air con did not work for 45 minutes when we were waiting to take off at 40C in Delhi airport (it worked fine once we were airborne), seats did not recline properly. No alcoholic beverages served and no communication from pilot or co-pilot whatsoever though the entire flight. Absolutely horrendous show and definitely not flying them again."
240,"✅ Trip Verified |  3 hours delayed, already 7 hours prior to the actual time. Absolutely no customer service. No sense of help, no sense of compensation. We were shocked. I do believe this stays a business client kind purchase and that at least some understanding comes with it. Couldn’t believe my eyes. No help. No nothing. Only answer, “this is not in our policy”… So, basically, airline with NO policy and no human interacting. Do not fly with them."
241,✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline. Also the airhostess were very rude. I booked business class tickets. The seats were completely uncomfortable. I had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused. The staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats. Also they had curtains closed in the middle row. The staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep.  How can the staff sleep in customer area. Business class facilities the staff were using. There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure. When I claimed I didn’t get any compensation. They are rude and worst airline. The staff is very unprofessional. 
242,"✅ Trip Verified |  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience."
243,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a window seat, and the person in the middle seat next to me had a broken screen. Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously. In addition to this, my seat and table were not exactly very clean (see attached photos). As a Star Alliance Member, I am severely disappointed."
244,"✅ Trip Verified | After having flown on various airlines including Qatar, Singapore, British Airways, Air France and Delta I finally decided to fly with Air India for the first time from Bengaluru to Singapore via Mumbai. The total journey was roughly 10 hours and surprisingly had a pleasant experience. Likes: Legroom - Had better legroom compared to other airlines - Food - provided food in both the flights which is not an option with most other airlines - Well behaved staff - On time baggage availability - Value for money - Use of minimal plastic cutlery Dislikes - There should have been an entertainment system at least in the international flights. Would have been added advantage - Seat cushion and comfort can be improved."
245,"Not Verified |  They are beyond unbelievable, not only are the workers clueless and rude. Once we were able to board our flight after many difficulties this airline caused, we were disgusted. The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes. They were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats ... when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us. I most certainly wouldn't choose to fly with Air India. "
246,"✅ Trip Verified |  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board."
247,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Delhi flight got cancelled after making us wait for 45 minutes at the boarding gate. Flight rescheduled to next day and information about the flight came at 10 pm in the night, made us wait for 1 hour at Delhi airport inside the aircraft. Horrible seat with no cushioning, in spite of paying additional SGD30 for the seat. Return flight from Delhi also got cancelled on the day of departure few hours before departure, I had to pay double the amount to buy another airline ticket in order to fly back to Singapore. Horrible, horrible airline."
248,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my husband travelled to India on April 18th, 2021. Due to national lockdown, the airlines were not operational on May 27th the day of return. We called Air India to cancel the return flight and we were told that we will receive a partial refund. It has been over an year. I have send over 20 emails to multiple email ids of Air India and called several times to AI customer service. This is the worst customer service. Several times the telephone operator hung up on me saying they are connecting me to their manager."
249,"Not Verified |  My Flight from Delhi to Toronto was 15 Hrs, TV was not working and I asked cabin crew and they said many of our TV is not working. Imagine 15 hrs flight with no TV and cabin crew service was very rude. I am not going to travel with Air India anymore and my family and friends."
250,"✅ Trip Verified |  Visakhapatnam to Delhi. Air India is the worst airline and a big shame to our country. Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease. Hope a positive change would come in future."
251,"✅ Trip Verified |  Myself and my wife were supposed to fly to Leh from Delhi this morning. After showing up to our flight at 4:45am (2 hours before the departure) we've been told by the airline staff that we could not fly because of overbooking. We've been told that we would need to find an alternative means of transport. This was at the check-in counters. After challenging it and asking to be rebooked to another flight they said there was nothing they could do. When we showed up at the service counter, they told us that we were late for our flight which simply was not true. The flight was indeed overbooked. The staff were extremely rude, unhelpful and unapologetic. On top of not being able to get to our destination, we now have to fight for a refund. This is a seriously bad customer service."
252,✅ Trip Verified |  I had flight to Toronto today but when I reached airport I was told that flight is overbooked and they don’t have seat. Airline staff had very rude and arrogant behaviour. So many senior citizens and passengers with child’s where also harassed. On top of that airline staff was disrespectful to everyone. I will not use air India ever again and would recommend others to avoid is airline. Never felt this insulted in my life before
253,"✅ Trip Verified |  Just appalled by the poor service from customer care. I was to fly back to London from Delhi but got covid. I had to change my flight (which they wouldn't let me do online or on call, someone had to be sent to their offices in Delhi) and was downgraded from Business to Economy. I was told I can apply for a refund but when I tried, they always say we'll get back to you and no one ever does. I've been writing to them consistently for over 3 months. The call centre is hopeless and no one has a clue whats going on. On email all I get are automated replies and every time I follow up a new query is created and the context of the case is lost. "
254,"Not Verified |  I have not even started my travel I fly on May 18, 2022, but till now I have not been able to contact the customer service. I just got off a call i was trying to make and I was on hold for 1h and 15min listening to COVID prevention commentary on a loop!  It is just impossible to get anyone to talk to you and most or all of the phone numbers do not work or has no one on the other side keeping with the standard work culture in India! I wanted to get some one to help me select a seat for my flights but cant do so. "
255,✅ Trip Verified |  This travel in Air India economy is the worst experience. Their ground staff service has improved however cabin service is poor. Food amount and service modified to do cost saving. Seats are uncomfortable and not a pleasant travel. Seats were dirty and pockets were filled with trash. Plane landed on time. Luggage arrived 50 minutes later. Overall a poor experience.
256,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was very disappointed by bad client service experience from Delhi airport by Air India team. First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs. After that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we can't do anything. For me it's the first and last Air India experience. "
257,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flights were relatively economical and more importantly available for the days I sought. I was very pleasantly surprised. Perhaps having low initial expectations was part of it, perhaps it is a reflection of the privatisation of AI but I found the flights enjoyable. The Boeing 787s were showing a bit if age, the IFE was limited, but the service was top notch, the crew were brilliant, food was great. I will definitely be travelling with AI again."
258,"Not Verified |  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue. "
259,"Not Verified |  My husband and I were traveling on AI126 on 07 April 2022 when we left a tablet. We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything). The machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it. No communication about it at all."
260,"Not Verified |  My wife had a carry on for her self and diaper bag for a 7 months old baby. We were harrased right before the boarding that diaper bag is not allowed. She could either bring her carry on or diaper bag. I showed this person from the Air India website that a personal item is allowed other than carry on such as laptop or diaper bag and threatened us that he will not let us take this flight. That was the end of discussion. Very rude staff, I will never fly with Air India again ever. Also for both inbound and outbound flights my in flight entertainment screen was broken. Imagine travelling 14 hours straight without screen."
261,"✅ Trip Verified |  They hadn’t served welcome drink or snack till major meal. In the meantime we asked for blanket nobody listened us. Screen was not working. I was waiting for water or some drink to take medicine they asked we will not serve in between meals you have to go at back and grab yourself. When they served meal chapati was missing, and they served snack items with major meal to save their time and energy. On the whole it was bad experience with this flight as I travelled first time with Air India so I will not recommend this flight to anybody."
262,Not Verified | Toronto to Delhi. My flight was cancelled without any information. Called up customer service and they were extremely rude. Horrible communication skills. I am still unsure when my flight is scheduled for. Pathetic airline. Disgusted.
263,✅ Trip Verified | Flights are always late in my experience of boarding 6 international and 10 plus domestic flights from same airline. Ground crew as well fight staff are rude. Inefficient communication via e-system (Apps/site/SMS/email) as well as inform of announcement on Gates. Extremely bad inflight entertainment and poor hygiene in general. Overall be ready for a very stressful travel if you choose this Airline.
264,"✅ Trip Verified | My flight from Toronto to Delhi was rescheduled without my knowledge. I learned that the flight was rescheduled to the next day after arriving at the airport. Airport staff had no idea of timing for the flight and I wasn't even provided a boarding pass. After that I tried to call Air India constantly for eight hours and every single person kept me on hold for 30 minutes and hung up later. Terrible customer support. Next day I reached the airport early morning as I wasn't told about the time, waited for 15 hours and I was told the flight is at midnight. I was provided a boarding pass for Toronto to Delhi and no confirmation for my connecting flight from Delhi to Vadodara. I waited at Toronto airport for 20 hours and flight took off at 4am in the morning. After I reached Delhi they said we cant give you any flight as your scheduled flight departed 2 days ago. The airport staff were extremely rude and started shouting. I waited another 16 hours at Delhi airport for a connecting flight. No one was sorry, no apologies and lot of disappointment. Wasted four days of my trip and my marriage had to postpone because of terrible service from Air India. My other six friends travelled around same week and everyone was tortured like this."
265,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited."
266,Not Verified |  The aircraft is spacious enough but that's not all customers would prefer. I used Air India to fly from Dubai to Delhi and return and both ways the entertainment screen wasn't working. on my way back the Armrest was damaged. After paying in full this is not what a customer would like to experience.
267,"Not Verified |  Worst seating, worst food, they don't even provide a lounge for the passenger whose flight got delayed. Worst service, I asked for the gate number as boarding pass didn't show as flight got delayed, the information desk had no idea. I don't know what else to say, local trains and busses are better than this. Not recommending anymore."
268,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India canceled the Flight due to covid 19 travel ban and closure of Airport, ticket attachments are related to year 2020. Still Kuwait to Chennai route is not operated by Air India though Ticket value is refused to reuse by rebooking or refund. Very disappointed by the attitude of Air India management and my Travel Agent CheapOair is emailed that Air India is rejected the Ticket value around Rs70000/- without any further correspondence. Like this cheating is very difficult for the customers to believe."
269,✅ Trip Verified |  It was the worst airline experience ever in AI187 on 20 April from Delhi to Toronto. A crew member was very rude & disrespectful . I was feeling cold in the aircraft & had requested her to give me a blanket. She didn’t pay any attention to what I had said & ignored completely. After an hour i had reminded her about it & she didn’t listen to me. I reminded her while serving food the third time & still no courtesy to reply back. While serving drinks she forgot to hand me over my drink & moved on. I had to stop her & literally request to serve me my drink. She didn’t even bother to apologize. She was very unprofessional with no smile.
270,✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to appreciate the ground staff of Air India working at Delhi airport. Sitender from Air India security and Pooja morning shift for going above and beyond to help my mother in law for assisting her to board a flight to Australia. The attention to detail provided by them was impressive and their customer service skills are excellent. They both are the fine ambassadors for Air India. Keep up the good work guys
271,"Not Verified |  Overall the customer service is extremely poor. Dirty plane, seats are dirty. Baggage check-in person was extremely rude. My bag did not arrive when I arrived. The phone# and email that I received from the baggage claim form is useless. Air India do not value their customers. No one will follow up regarding missing bags. After 50 phone calls and numerous emails with no response, we ended up going back at the airport three times, finally we had some luck with meeting with supervisor. After one long week, we received the bag. No compensation was provided for the troubles that we went through. It was the worst experience from our last travel. Every encounter we had, not one person made us feel that they cared. I am very disappointed with my travel experience."
272,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled by Air India from London Heathrow to Cochin on 19th March. This was my first experience after Tata had taken over Air India and this was the worst experience I ever had with an airline. The interior of the flight was quite old looking, passenger hand rest were broken and wrapped with insulation tape. Moreover, the seat was torn and dirty. I don’t want to mention anything about toilet cleanliness. Food quality was pathetic, quality came down drastically, not at all tasty. "
273,✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst experiences of my life in flying. The ground staff was rude and did not know how to handle edge cases. I got sick due to extreme heat and on requesting priority check-in it was provided but the experience is worst than normal check-in. The duty Manager was rude and did not handle it well even on explaining the health condition. The Inflight experience was also not good. Food was stale (Breakfast and Lunch). The flight attendants were also not courteous and did not come to attend to the passenger (me) even 2 hrs after calling. InFlight entertainment was also not working. Seems flight attendants are there for sake of being there not for service. Better go for any other Airline.
274,"✅ Trip Verified | We recently flew Business Class on London->Delhi->Bagdogra and returned Kolkata->Delhi->London. Except for on-schedule flights, nothing seems to have changed under the new ownership. No entertainment system available and even the flight attendants seemed unaware. Then the lame excuse - ""our entertainment system is getting updated under new ownership"". We didn't even bother to try the entertainment system on any further leg. The Priority tags on the luggage were the biggest jokes, except at Heathrow, almost everywhere, we got our luggage almost at the end. During our return, we had a 4 hours wait at Delhi Intl. terminal and there was no lounge facility available. I would have expected them to have an arrangements with other airlines or providers. I feel, it will take time for Air India to change its archaic and unprofessional model."
275,✅ Trip Verified |  The inflight entertainment was not working. They did not have pillows for passengers and you literally had to ask them for blankets as it was very cold in the aircraft. Food was not up to standard. Cabin staff were good
276,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I entered the Air India aircraft (Boeing 777) there was no fresh smell but a sensation of stale air. During the 15-hour flight, none of the tv screens was working. The announcement was made over the public address system that the tv screens were faulty, for which they apologized.  AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services.  Throughout the flight, people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water. For lunch they also included the snack meant for tea, so crew can be spared the trouble of serving again at tea time. The flight was so deplorable that I cancelled my return trip to Vancouver by Air India and booked on Lufthansa instead, even though I had to lose a substantial amount of money. Never again Air India in my life."
277,✅ Trip Verified |  It was a totally chaotic experience. No web check in from Vancouver as it is not in the drop down list.I called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much. The flight is totally basic. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The seats are broken and dirty. No reading light or call button. Thankfully I was forewarned so I had downloaded movies for kids on their computers. I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves. They commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by AI. The lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids. On the whole I would not recommend this flight. New management has a huge task ahead of them.
278,"Not Verified |  I realize that Tatas have a huge task ahead of them to set the airline on a proper trajectory. However, my experience was not bad except the food which was the worst I’ve ever had. The staff were excellent and the overall flight was very comfortable and on time."
279,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute worst flight experience! The aircraft was so old and broken down. The seats were super uncomfortable. Most of the TVs did not work. The staff was extremely rude and did their job horribly. When I complained about the TV not working, they did nothing to help. The overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work. When I asked for water, they told me to go to the back and get it myself. The bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight. I will never be travelling on this airline again and do not recommend anyone else to either!"
280,✅ Trip Verified | Our flight was cancelled at 12.30 when all customers were waiting for boarding which is unacceptable and an alternative flight was also not arranged which is completely zero tolerance. Refund is not the solution for this as we have value for our time. An alternative should have been kept in case of technical issues.
281,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled in AI 309 Melbourne to New Delhi. It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier."
282,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am horrified! I've never been treated so badly in my entire life! I showed up for my flight 3 hours early. When I went to check in, I was asked if I had filled out the Air Suvidha form. I had not, as I had not been notified by Air India that this form was required, and I looked all over their website and found no mention of this form. I have been to India 4 times before and knew to have all my pertinent documents with me, which I did, but nobody told me I had to upload them to a special website. Filling out the form was impossible to do on a cell phone, I couldn't get the documents to be small enough, so the form kept being rejected. There was nobody there helping all the people who had not filled out the form because none of them were notified in advance. There were a half dozen of us that were not permitted to check in because we were unable to complete the form on our cell phones, among those turned away were an elderly couple and a young couple with an infant baby. This is totally unconscionable! The couple with the infant baby asked if they could at least be compensated with a hotel room, and the heartless Air India employee behind the counter said, sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Then to add insult to injury, when trying to rebook the flight, Air India is charging a $300 no show fee. This airline doesn't care in the least about customer service. I will never book a flight with Air India again. Do yourself a favor and book with a different airline."
283,"✅ Trip Verified |  Now after take over by Tata, change is visual when flying Air India. Did web checkin and no check in baggage so no experience of Check in/ Boarding was smooth, also flown on time and arrived on time. In flight meal was good though now they should start serving non veg in economy class too which was stopped by management few years back. Staff were courteous."
284,"Not Verified |  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again."
285,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight I travelled ever. My flight was of 16 hrs non stop and the screen in front of me was not working at all I was not able to watch any safety protocols or see where the flight is currently, route, weather conditions. No entertainment on the 16 hrs flight. It felt like I was in a black hole or something like that. I requested the flight attendants to turn the screen on or change the seat if the screen is broken and they responded in humiliating and disrespectful way and did nothing.  If the screen was not working why did you allotted the seat to me, it was very unfair with me."
286,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight experience ever, the chairs were broken, one couldn’t recline and other won’t stop reclining. There was a chewing gum just in front of my seat. No regular service, ring the bell and nobody will come for hours and eventually you have to go get water and everything you want. The armrest was broken as shown in the photo here. They have screen but earphones don’t work. I asked for a cup of tea I was told we are serving food right now so later will bring it, after an hour I went again n was told sorry now we can’t give you anything as we will land in one hour and we forgot to bring before. The whole crew was sitting in the back chilling."
287,✅ Trip Verified |  My wife's with my Infant flight was delayed 5 hrs from the actual arrival time so the domestic connecting flight missed and next flight after 10 Hrs at the airport. No food and no proper accommodation provided because of their mismanagement and my wife had to sit the whole night with luggage and our 8-month child at the Delhi airport. Complaint on the airline's website but after 1.5 months also no acknowledgment of their mistakes nor a simple reply back.
288,"Not Verified |  We had purchased a business class seat for my mother as she recently had major surgeries and her legs needed to stay elevated throughout the journey. The seat recline didn't work the entire time, the seat was normal as an economy class. The main reason for us to buy the Biz class for the comfort of her travel which was not the case here at all. I have try calling AI since last three days no answer. If you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up. I have submitted an online feedback no respond. I have sent an email no response. We were told by the crew member that since she had an issue with her seat she would get a refund back, but how will one get a refund if there is no way to contact anyone?  This was waste of our money. I do not recommend anyone to fly Air India."
289,"Not Verified |  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery."
290,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to Muscat. Please don't travel in this airline. I have been waiting for refund around 12000rs since last 1 year, every time when we call customer care they will tell some stories."
291,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time flying Air India after its acquisition by its founding owners Tatas and to be honest I was'nt expecting much of a change in the hard product given the turnaround of the interiors, etc would take time and I would give them at least a year to refurbish their entire fleet and replace older planes with newer ones. However, I did expect to see changes in the Soft Product like Ground staff, Cabin Crew, Inflight meals and most Importantly the On Time Performance. I was very impressed with the overall time management of the ground staff who ensured on time boarding. The Cabin crew was courteous and ensured that all the pax wore masks for the entire duration of the flight. Air India offers free refreshments or meals on a short 60 Minute flight like this one so I was served a refreshment box with a veg puff, tetra juice pack, Tomato ketchup and and the crew was kind enough to serve me another snack box when I requested. Overall it was a great short flight and would fly them again."
292,"✅ Trip Verified |  Traveling with Air India get worse and worse. They don't provide pillow and blankets, they don't serve soft drinks, hard drink, tea or coffee on seat. You have to go the service station, sometime passengers don't know and they wait all the time for drinks. Like me and didn't announce that. For snacks they serve that 10rupees bread cold sandwich and  breakfast quality is ok. When you ask them for these things they give excuse of COVID. So from my experience I would not recommend anybody to travel with them."
293,Not Verified | I will never book ticket with Air India. They cancelled the flight 12 hours before and scheduled it two days later. Again they canceled 12 hours before second time and scheduled to next day. Customer care support is worst and they just keep your call in hold more than hour and simply cut the call without details and also they never call back even mentioned to give a call back if call dropped in between. I had to call 5 times to speak with customer care support and it took more than 5 hours. Worst management and they don't care about customer satisfaction. I am not going to travel with Air India.
294,"✅ Trip Verified |  During the summer of 2020 I wasn’t able to take the plane because of covid, and my 700€ ticket still to this day hasn’t been refunded. I have called and waited, and spent so much energy on this company, but they took me for a fool and still haven’t been able to refund me. Their service company is horrible and several times they have hung up on me while I was waiting. Never ever buy a ticket from them as you will never be paid back if you do not take the plane"
295,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had to transit through Delhi and was asked to do a repeat PCR in spite of already holding a negative PCR report from my first flight. By the time I got the test done in the airport, I lost my connection. I approached the desk of Air India and was told there was a later flight and I need to pay 3000 INR to get into that flight. I arranged to pay but they asked to see the negative report of the new test. When I brought the report I was told now the change fee had increased to 4500 rupees. In desperation, I agreed but was told they would only change the flight after I brought the luggage that was checked on the earlier flight. I got my luggage and as expected the counter staff of Air India told me now the change fee had become 7000 rupees. I was desperate to reach my destination and paid it but I dread to even think the plight of those who were wailing at the counters since they did not have the means to pay."
296,"Not Verified |  Never travel with Air India again. Firstly they cancelled the flight a day before and never even bothered to inform us. As we had already checked in they took our boarding pass and gave as a new one which stated a night flight. After such long wait and discussion back then they shifted us on the next day morning flight. Later when we were there they emphasised on RTPCR even after having double vaccination certificate and rude staff was so keen on making our experience worst stating don't keep the bag like this keep like that, as if we were the porters for her. "
297,"Not Verified | Booking a ticket online is such a pain. I tried booking online from Australia and everytime the payment failed. Then I tried booking via the tickets via their 24 hrs helpline and I had to call their call center multiple times for a total duration of 5 hrs before I could finally book the tickets. For every call, the Call center agent verifies the details again and then transfers the call to the ticketing team for booking, cancellations, rescheduling and refunds. But then the call gets disconnected invariably after 30 mins. I faced this same issue when I tried to reschedule my return domestic flight as my original flight was cancelled. Why can we not access the direct line to the ticketing team when are actually choosing that option while calling the call center? I think this is the biggest pain, please fix this. I will not prefer to travel with Air India unless I am in a pinch. Online booking and Call center delays are the biggest two issues which will keep the customer away, so please fix this."
298,"Not Verified | San Francisco to Delhi. Everything went pretty smoothly from check in to boarding. However, the flight wasn’t the best. The IFEs barely worked, so we didn’t have entertainment for nearly 5-6 hours until they fixed it. The seats were also very uncomfortable, so I barely got any sleep. The cabin crew was friendly, and the meals were nice. I would say to not fly Air India for international travel."
299,"Not Verified |  Please do not use Air India unless it's an absolute emergency 80% 9f their inflight entertainment systems don't work, this is for an international flight of 15 hours. Baggage check in take 2 hours at a minimum. There was incorrect communication on baggage transfers and people lost their bags. Absolute horrendous experience."
300,"Not Verified | Ease of booking: No problem except the Travel Agent could not insert your frequent flyer number (if outside of Air India) during ticket booking. Had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the United frequent flyer was printed on the Boarding Pass. Air India should ensure that any Star Alliance number can be inserted into the booking. Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked. Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew, very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens. Air India Lounge at Delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic. I flew from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes. My own business class seat was changed in favor of a Captain's daughter flying on the flight. Air India can do much better by not disturbing or bumping around paying passengers in favor of non-paying ones. Delhi Airport Crowd management can be improved a lot, especially during these pandemic times."
301,"Not Verified |  The flight was supposed to take off by 11.50am, however even at 3.45pm (almost 4hrs now) there is absolutely no clue what is going on, still awaiting any announcements about when we would take off. To make it worse even the crew or pilot cant make any meaningful announcements to let people know of the condition, absolutely radio silence except for all kids screaming and people impatiently walking about. Did I mention broken display, so no entertainment either."
302,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst customer service experience ever. Called 8 times and spoke to 8 different customer service representatives about refund my ticket. Some times representative would cut my call. This didn't happen once or twice but four times!. Horrible airline with horrible customer service and not worth the money at all.
303,Not Verified |  Worst customer service experience ever. Called 4 times and spoke to 7 different customer service representatives about changing my ticket but as soon as I confirmed the change and was about to pay the representative would cut my call. This didn't happen once or twice but four times in one day! I told the latter representatives that I urgently needed to change my ticket and could not keep calling back and being transferred but they kept doing the same thing. Due to this the ticket availability went from 9th December to 1st January 2022 and when I finally was able to book the 1st of Jan the representative cut my call again. Horrible airlines with horrible customer service and not worth the money at all.
304,✅ Trip Verified |  I was impressed with the legspace even on this small aircraft. Though Air India usually offers snacks on even short flights but due to covid it was not available on this flight. Water bottles were served to all passengers. Flight was on time and landed a few minutes before arrival time. Overall a good experience on this short sector and thankful to air India for being the only airline to be operating on this route and that too at a reasonable price.
305,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Air India on a single-leg domestic flight of less than an hour. Unfortunately Air India lost my luggage on this flight. While I understand that accidents like these happen on any airline, Air India's customer support has been absolutely pathetic ever since. Calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either don't work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods. The specific phone numbers I received to the team handling my case at Goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages (even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number, so I strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number). At this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag, and a week since I last managed to get through to Air India (despite daily attempts to do so). In short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating, and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage. Apart from not having much confidence in Air India trying to return my luggage to me, my attempts to get compensated for (1) additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and (2) for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well. I was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the Goa team, after which my case would get updated with them and I'd retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global Air India office. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back on this email address after a week, and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after I leave India is bonkers. In my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from Air India the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through Twitter, but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case. Concluding, I would advise everyone to avoid Air India at all cost as any circumstance in which you'd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating. While I would expect non-budget national carriers and Star Alliance members offer some basic level of service, this is not at all the case for Air India."
306,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recently I traveled with Air India and experienced a worst experience with this airline. We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family. Their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight. Now I can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years. The attitude of the staff is sinking this boat."
307,"Flight departure time was 11.55am which was delayed to 1.55pm. Passengers were allowed to board flight at 1pm. Pilot found some technical issue at the last moment and could not be fixed in 9 hours. It is 9.15pm, I am still on the flight which has not taken off. Passengers were provided a meal once only and status updates were not given frequently which left people clueless and frustrated. In terms of interior, seats can't be pushed back more than an inch, screens not functioning properly, provided meal was also tasteless. Overall the worst experience. When I asked an attendant to provide water, she said it was kept in the galley, get it from there. Blanket and cushion is not provided in flight. I would be inclined towards zero rating for all criteria."
308,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am Extremely disappointed with the ground crew staff of Air India at Ahmedabad airport. I was travelling on 12th Nov 2021 from Ahmedabad to Chicago via Delhi. My flight was at 7:35 PM and I was inside airport at 5:30 PM. The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule. When my travel agent directly contact to higher authorities from Air India and explained that they are wrong, I was issued board passes after 2 hours of harassment by Air India. The aircraft was so dirty and unhygienic to even fly. This was very old aircraft and there was food stuck in side the TV remote and all inside the seat corners. The seats were even damaged and broken joints for food tray."
309,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have taken Air India TVM-BLR flight. They cancelled the flight at the last moment, after I reached airport and redirected via BOM and ended up flying more than 4 hrs to reach Bangalore from Trivandrum (Which is just 1 hr). The assigned seat numbers were so messed up that I have seen at least 4 such cases were multiple people are assigned same seats, including mine. I am appalled by the lack of processes and untrained ground staff who are completely helpless most of the time."
310,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India repeatedly disappoints. This trip on 14 November left me speechless and hugely disappointed. Food Tray was broken and I asked for a change of seat - Flight attendant's answer no seats available and I have to adjust with Food tray as he can't do anything until the flight reaches London. I have to use my own lap to eat the food. I have asked for Non-Veg, as I have already eaten Veg first time - Flight attendant answer - Sorry no options and Veg is the only option. My next seat customer has got the Non-Veg after some heated discussion, still no luck for me.  Seat recliner push-button broken hence can not push back. Flight attendant response - Cant do anything, we will check and sort this in London. Forget about charging ports, as all the USB ports are broken and inhouse media needs to reboot twice to work the Multimedia. I request to provide me with a blanket as I have seen few customers were offered. Flight attendant said we don't have enough in stock."
311,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst experience in my life time. The flight was supposed to be a direct flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad at 6.50pm on 13th Nov 2021. Suddenly a text message on the morning of the 13th that the boarding time is at 03.10pm. It's the first shock, reached airport leaving all my day plans. Later the flight started around 4.00pm. One more shock on the plane is its via Kolhapur. In a very bad mood we reached Kolhapur at 5.40pm, its suppose to leave by 5.50pm, the Kolhapur staff were informed by the airline staff that they have to take off on or before 5.50pm. Again it got delayed and the flight was not started till 6.15pm. Suddenly an announcement that the flight can't take off due to bad weather when we can see the stars and the moon clearly. So many people had connecting flights to travel abroad. They have given back our luggage and not said anything. I waited till 8.30pm with no update, at least on next day timings. Then I left to catch a bus to Hyderabad, couldn't and had to come back to Bangalore. My return from Hyderabad is on 14th Nov 2021 at 08.15pm. I have planned for a day to attend my clients place. Everything has gone in vain. I never recommend Air India to anyone."
312,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had my first experience with Air India recently, and I have to say it has been up there as possibly the most disappointing experience I have ever had. In summary, if you have a choice - please choose another proper airline. This was a flight long haul from London to Bombay. The ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to Business Class using FR miles. Prior to flying I needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare. I wasted hours of my time trying to call them. I managed to get through to one person, who when I explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem, what’s the problem. Then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h. Very confusing that he would say that, and not try to help me, and not collect any of my personal details. I never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call, with the queue position going up and down like a yo-yo. Shocking, beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services, that really damages Air India’s credibility with me. Anyway I went to the airport, I was concerned about extra check during COVID times so I arrived 3.5 hours before departure. Air India refused to allow me to check in early, despite the Business Counter being in use by economy passengers. Now I know I was early, so partially my fault. However at one stage other BOM passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while I had to wait for be allowed to go to the Business Class check-in. By the time I checked in, there was one BOM economy passenger I recognised that reached the counter before me. Business Class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling, or add a little luxury. I travel in economy for personal travel about 99% of the time, as we all have bills to pay. However when I upgrade to business class, I expect to enjoy it and see the benefit. After this ordeal I was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at London Heathrow, luckily it was a Star Alliance lounge run by another airline, phew! I’m glad it wasn’t an Air India lounge, lest I would be subjected to further torture. At the boarding gate more fun and games I’m afraid. One giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk. This meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers, just one big line to wait in. More stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided. On the plane, as expected a tired cabin, outdated infotainment. The seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options. The infotainment screen was low resolution, and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as Etihad. The Business Class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight, such as 4-5h, not a 9+h flight. I will write a complaint to Air India. I don’t expect to receive anything back."
313,✅ Trip Verified | Services have downgraded tremendously. They made all the passengers sit in the flight for about 30-40 mins without switching on the Air Conditioner. When customers asked they did nothing about it. People were using papers to fan themselves. The flight didn’t take off on time or land on time. My seat was also changed post boarding while entering the flight manually without my consent like it was a local train. When I asked for a reason later they stated it was because I was a solo traveller. The staff was also very aggressive in their tone and behaviour.
314,✅ Trip Verified |  I hold a business class ticket for this flight and I was told in the counter of check-in I am the only passenger in business class. When I board I see it's occupied by the crew members and I don't have space in cabin to put my luggage.
315,Not Verified |  Flight got delayed for 2 times. All the passengers who booked for this flight were very upset including me. There was no proper announcement when the gate was changed. I’ve never seen this kind of bad experience with any airline. 
316,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst experience. We had booked our tickets 9th October 2021 to Amritsar. It was said that we will reach Amritsar by 9.50 am but to our surprise we reached Amritsar at 11.30 am. They had merged our flight with Indore and so we went Amritsar via Indore. We had to attend function and that's why we took early flight so that we reach on time. We missed our function and also lost all our mood to attend function. Such irresponsible behaviour of reputed airline is not acceptable ,they should have informed us so that we could have modified our travel. Would not recommend Air India."
317,"✅ Trip Verified |  It was a short one hour flight and despite having not web checked in the check in officials were prompt to help me with the kiosk machine as I didnt know how to use them. One of the most impressive thing about Air India is their 25Kg Luggage allowance. The flight was on time and landed before scheduled arrival time though there was no meal service, the crew distributed water bottles and Safety kits. The IFE was working well but due to short course of flight I just had the flight tracker on. Overall a wonderful experience."
318,"Not Verified |  I contacted Air India for ticket cancellation. They cancelled the ticket and confirmed that I will receive the refund. I booked the ticket through an agency, but they asked me to contact Air India directly because they said they don't have the cancellation option from their side. I cancelled the ticket in April 2021 and waited till Oct 2021 for my refund. I called them at least 10 to 15 times within this 4-5 months period. Every time, they say it is in process or they have initiated the refund. Finally, on 14th Oct. 2021, I called them again and requested the status. The lady, who picked my call first was so impatient and she forwarded my call to some other department and didn't even wait for me to finish what I was trying to say. The next customer service assistant told me they don't have some number required from the booking agency. Then I asked her why you guys did not tell me this all these days (I must have called them at least 10-15 times, every 2 weeks I used to call). I requested her to connect me to the Manager/Supervisor. She immediately disconnected the call. I'm an Indian, but I will try my level best to avoid Air India. If you are fine dealing with unprofessional and rude customer service, go ahead and book your ticket."
319,Not Verified |  Never ever book through air India. I booked the ticket from Delhi to Goa on August 2021 and due to some circumstances I have cancelled my ticket before 15 days. But I tried to contact customer service to refund my ticket amount but till date it has not been refunded. I’m trying call them again and again to collect my refundable amount but they never bother about the customer service.
320,✅ Trip Verified |  On 08/10/2021 I had a flight on AirIndia from Mumbai to Hyderabad Before the beginning of the flight itself I was feeling tired hyperventilating and was sick. The air steward came to help and assisted me cleaning up. He offered me and the nearby passenger change in seats. Throughout the journey this steward gave me company whilst doing his duties. He made me drink water every half an hour and offered me biscuits. At the end of the trip he made sure I was all okay. 
321,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst flight ever with the worst ever staff. We booked an air india flight to Goa, but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception. There was an 11 month baby with us. At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate. The air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasn't the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us. Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted. I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call. After 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side. While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down. The staff was highly rude and no cooperative and it was a terrible experience. The mother with the infant wasnt given any preference for the seat even after requesting them. It was one of the most terrible experience ever. "
322,"Not Verified |  I had connecting flight of air India from Amritsar to Delhi, from Delhi i had international flight to Vancouver. Air India was delayed by 2 hours. Then they said flight is delayed by another 3 hours. Later they said flight is cancelled, there was no bad weather or any adverse conditions. Because of them my connecting flight got missed. I was traveling with my wife, 2 years old girl and 1 year boy. Whole night we had to spend on airport. No accommodation, food, or refund provided. Had to purchase 4 new tickets. Staff at Delhi airport was so rude. We were crying over there with kids, never felt that helpless in my life. It was a nightmare."
323,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute nightmare. boarding delayed for 15 hours due to technical difficulties and no option to cancel/reschedule flight. All they said is that they will take care of everyone. Now, that would be spending another night at the airport and wait time of 12 more hours for connecting flight to destination. Used to be a convenient direct airlines to India but this is such a pathetic and horrifying experience. I would never travel again with Air India. Senior citizens with might think it is convenient to travel directly from US to India but on the contrary it is an absolute nightmare."
324,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India is worst airline. They are just fetching money from its flyers. I reached at window 45mins prior to my flight departure. And they said that boarding is closed. And they cannot do anything with it, and we have to book a new ticket and have to pay full amount. We cancelled our plan to take next flight. But on schedule board it was showing same flight was on boarding stage till 15mins prior to departure. There were more people like us. "
325,"✅ Trip Verified |  Despite having paid extra for a specific seat when I booked the ticked, Air India staff assigned my seat to someone else after I had checked in for the flight. My boarding pass was already printed and given to me with the seat I had chosen at booking, but Air India staff subsequently assigned my seat to someone else. On the plane, when I raised the issue, the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation. They then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat, one without a TV, which all other passengers had. Mind you, this was for a 15-hour flight. I understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted, but surely there were others on the plane who hadn't paid for their seats, so their seats should be changed, not those of us who paid for our seating. In addition, it's outrageous that Air India would give my seat to someone else after I checked in and had the my boarding pass with my proper seat number printed on it."
326,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew from Newark to Delhi airport. The service provided on the flight was the worst. No blanket, no pillow, no coffee/tea nothing. As per air hostess, the flight was under COVID-restriction travel, so nothing to be provided to the passengers. I don't understand then why they are charging more from us, if you don't want to provide us with all amenities. If this was a COVID flight, we expect some cleanliness but there was no hygiene. The air hostesses were so rude sometimes. They didn't allow us to use some restrooms because of their safety concerns. Really! As we are traveling, this doesn't mean that we have COVID. We all sat on that flight with a negative COVID test, at least give us some respect. I will never recommend."
327,"Not Verified |  Never book any flight with this airline as they have extremely poor service, pathetic staff, worst customer service and unprofessional behaviour. They treat passengers as if they are traveling on a free ride with the airline and have no plans to reach the destination. There is no acknowledgement about the delays and no support for refund or reschedule. The refund takes more than 6 months sometimes! My Luggage was damaged and Company ID was lost while returning from Udaipur to Mumbai. How can this airline treat passengers so casually?"
328,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India Customer Service is unprofessional and customer service numbers are down all the time. No update given on their website or info to travel agents. I was suppose to cancel my flight to Tirupati but as there customer care lines are down, I had to call them back next day of my booking. Since I did not reach out to them 24 hours after the ticket was booked, the amount is not refundable. Stop booking Air India rather Indigo really helped me with regard to full refund."
329,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had booked the tickets online, and we could easy book the tickets on the Air India Website and also got the email confirmation immediately. Even now it shows that the status as confirmed. We went to the airport with all the luggage and all and we came to know that Air India flights are not been flying since more than a month now. So now why are we allowed to book the tickets when the flights are not flying at all. Secondly the systems at Air India Customer care are not at all updated and they have no idea or update of the current status of the flights. We would have called at least 10 times and every time they mentioned flight is confirmed and later after several transfer to escalation team and all we get to know that flights are not flying. Now at maharaja we got the update that the flight is not flying, however it is a scam and trying to fool people as till yesterday in maharaja It was showing out name and details for the particular flight but today is says it is cancelled. Are the website and customer care people not aware of the current status or are they doing it knowingly to collect money from people and not refund it.Its a big scam going on that too when Indian government is involved. Now when we call for refund we are directed to several teams on the call on long waits and no one is able to give a proper solution. Not sure if we will ever get the money back. Really frustrated, along with that we also did the RTPCR test which cost around 600$ for 3 of us. we had given several calls before going for the test just to be sure and conformed and the Customer care guys mentioned it is confirmed. At the Airport we met 4 other families who had booked on the same flight on same date and were facing the same issue. I am sure Air India is earning a lot from these false booking and not refunding the money. People be aware before you choose Air India. I know these writing and comments doesn't effect Air India however just for the knowledge and awareness for people to be cautious and not suffer."
330,"✅ Trip Verified |  They will take your money and you will never see it again, even if you do your due diligence and cancel within 24 hours, even if you call them every other day for 2 month, wait on hold for hours, write 20 emails and create 5 escalated cases with their sub standard, rude and good for nothing customer support agents. All of the above happened to me. I booked a business class ticket and tried to cancel online but the system was down so I called to cancel within 24 hours. But the customer support agent casually said, and I quote ""please call back later. The system is undergoing maintenance and I cannot cancel at this time"". That was my first red flag. What kind of an agent cannot cancel even if the user cannot cancel? So I left an email asking them to cancel within 24 hours. I called several times after that and I got the same response:  I'd have to pay the $200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed. Otherwise, they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level. That the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails That I'd get a response within 24 to 48 hours (but didnt). Even if I did, it was always automated or tightly scripted (was I ever talking to a human?). Exhausted with the constant back and forth and going nowhere for 1 month but before my flight date, I called them to cancel my booking, agreeing to pay the $200. I was promised that my escalated case would be seen to and I'd get back my $200 fee but it never was. I left them multiple requests in email, on their feedback form but talking to these people is like talking to a wall. "
331,"✅ Trip Verified |  I cancelled my Air India tickets in April 2021, I have not fully refunded my money back yet. I have called and e-mailed several time, no response from anybody at all. There is significant delay in refunding money, the same is happing to my friends with Air India. Some of my friends still waiting for refunds for more than a six months. Nobody from Air India is accountable for this poor service. Very pathetic customer service. Decided not ever plan to use in the future this air lines again."
332,"✅ Trip Verified |  My son who is a minor was booked on a non-stop flight Dubai to Bengaluru. Suddenly I receive this message saying flight is re-scheduled Dubai-Delhi-Bengaluru, where he needs to waste 12 hours of precious time at Delhi airport to take the Bengaluru flight and now I get another message saying he has to fly Dubai-Delhi-Cochin-Bengaluru. Is this airline out of their minds? Especially during Covid time instead of operating direct flights re-scheduling via via. What nonsense is this I do not understand. Never take this flights."
333,"✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled flight last year in April 2020 due to lockdown, since then we are chasing for your refund and till date I am sending emails, writing them on twitter but their services are so pathetic, they have no system or SOPs to handle issues related to refund. If you check their Twitter Account everyday people are asking for refund but they give pre scripted typical answers to everyone. There is a scam it seems, many customers have given up, their hard earned money been eaten up by Air India."
334,"✅ Trip Verified |  The bad experience starts as soon as you enter the Airport at the check in desk. No availability of online-check in, no line management for different types of check in (at the counter, online). After 45 minutes of standing in the queue, as there were not enough Staff for the number of passengers checking in, boarding began with the boarding pass being checked minimum 4 times (could never understand why this happens on Indian domestic and International flights only). No inflight entertainment, seats were broken. Food was the only plus which made the journey bearable. Overall- very disappointed, and it seemed from their lacklustre service that Air India just doesn't care. No improvement during the return leg of the journey from Del-Fra. They capitalised on the Passengers vulnerabilty during the Holidays by putting in service the old-worst serviced planes. PS: the prices were 1,5 times the normal prices."
335,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very poor food, flight is very dirty and seats are not comfortable and even found a panel laying side to the seat. Entertainment system barely works and don't have any options so it is better not to work. They don't do any sort of maintenance inside the flight."
336,"✅ Trip Verified |  While booking LHR-COK with return it will show up connecting via Bombay, Delhi or Bangalore with long waiting to COK, but return will be direct from COK-LHR. We all book as at least we can have a nonstop flight from COK. But they will cancel the flight 4 or 5 days before your return journey. Then will end up with finding another airline with huge amount of fare. Partial refund from Air India will take 9 months and the maximum partial refund will be £150 per ticket. Don’t ever use Air India."
337,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience ever. Changing a flight is a pain - you have to contact customer service and it takes forever and is not transparent. Flights are super old - my moms entertainment system screen was white for the entire trip and didn’t work. Mine wouldn’t turn on. Seats seem like they’re over 10 years old with all kinds of stains. Flight delays galore, all the flights were delayed by at least half hour and the worst was 3 hours. "
338,"Not Verified |  The worst customer service. We booked a flight for a later date which had to be preponed. We called the customer service department and requested to reschedule the flight to a month earlier. We paid the fare difference and in spite of all that we were not given the itinerary. We called them for three days literally, 20 times. Now, they are asking us to pay more amount. We requested for full refund and they are only giving us 600 rupees out of 6000. I am going to make sure that I never book any tickets from this airline."
339,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked the flight mainly because of the cheap fare compared to other airlines (due to covid only a few options were available). Check-in and boarding were smooth. They served good food on time, however, did not serve any drinks (coffee/tea/ alcohol). It was at the back of the airlines for self-service. Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service. Also, the air conditioning was not properly working on the ground. It was very suffocating after wearing mask and face shield. Air India is one of the two domestic airlines that provide hot meals. But they serve the only veg meal. The meals were so so."
340,"Not Verified |  Flight was okay to travel as we don't have many choices in Pandemic. Staff were helpful. However, none of the phone chargers were working because they were all broken. I was lucky that my phone was charged and did not need to use it. In this day and age, all information and important documents are on the phone so phone chargers should be available."
341,"✅ Trip Verified |  After avoiding Air India for years, I was forced to spend my hard earned money on them for a round trip between IAD and MAA because of the Indian government forbidding sixth freedom traffic under the covid air bubble agreements. I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels."
342,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible experience with customer care and staff. Customer care promised me 30kg as I had next day international flight, but they charged me 5040 rupees for 8kg. Really horrible and low level service. They don't understand your concern. "
343,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had decided to use my miles to redeem the flight from Mangalore after having a good vacation and was able to successfully book the flight and select my seat without any issues. The check in and baggage drop was quick and easy. The load on this flight was on the lighter side and so as a result the flight was by and large very uneventful. Boarding also started well ahead of time and as far as the inflight service was concerned, only a drink was provided. The arrival and baggage collection was also done swiftly. For a journey which was redeemed using miles, it was worth the value and the process was very smooth. "
344,"✅ Trip Verified |  The Ticketing staff at Delhi Terminal 3 is worst. I had to stand for 2 hours just to drop bags even after e-checking and when my turn came I was thrown here and there and charged Rs 20,000 for luggage weight. I don’t Mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit. The desk person let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her, why do you want to weigh it, if you can lift it, that means it’s not that’s heavy, and the same guy charged me around Rs 600 per kg. I don’t mind doing that but what I saw him doing with that girl is totally unprofessional. Save yourself from a rude experience by not traveling by Air India."
345,"✅ Trip Verified |  My original travel date was on 16th January and flight has been re-scheduled three times. Worst thing is that their call centre staff are so rude, so never again!!"
346,"✅ Trip Verified |  The staff are not at all polite. They are so rude and are doing things in their on will. Not following protocols or any rules. I was flying from Cochin to Delhi then to Toronto in a Air India connection flight. The Air India staff from Delhi did not let me fly even when I had a valid PCR report with me. They were so rude and they stopped me from boarding telling that they need to verify my result. The supervisor at the Delhi Airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why I'm not eligible to travel. Then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day.  I stayed there from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in Air India asking about this issue. No one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me. The supervisors are even worse with no responsibility. They even took back my boarding pass from Delhi to Toronto to take away the proof. Worst ever flight experience and I lost 1 lakh 10,000 rupees for a new ticket. They didn't even refund me or didn't do anything even when they did the wrong thing to me. "
347,"✅ Trip Verified | On this flight from Kolkata to Bangalore, when I tried to do the web check in, I came to know that the flight got rescheduled by 2 hours which was unexpected and not exactly welcome as we were hoping to save some time. Also when doing the web check in, I was also surprised to see that the system was unable to recognize the PNR which was quite strange, however the mobile check in was successful and even though the timing of the flight was uncertain, just 1 day before the departure, the airline provided a confirmation of the flight timings via SMS. The baggage drop and ground process was quick and smooth. Boarding was on schedule and the departure was also slightly delayed by 15 mins due to the air show in Bangalore. However the crew made up for the time en-route. The airline has also resumed full meal service and lunch was provided which was a welcome addition. The meal was good and nice and we landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule which was good. The web check in experience could have been better and also the rescheduling was not exactly welcome but the inflight experience was quite nice and the crew was very good in looking after the passengers. I would fly with Air India again in the future for the right price and timing convenience but they need to try to minimize the rescheduling of flights."
348,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst staff behaviour ever! My flight was 16:15 on jan 25th but it reschedule by 20 min earlier to 15:55 on the same day. I reached airport (boarding pass counter) at 15:05. They checked I have done my web checking also, immediately they said the luggage belt is close but boarding is going on but I can’t go with my luggage. I have to throw it there. I said I’ll carry my with me in hand luggage but still they not ready. Finally after five minutes they argued I decide to throw my 1 luggage in dustbin so at least I can go, but still they said we don’t have time to to do all this. Very rude arrogant attitude they have."
349,Not Verified |  I am having such a terrible experience with Air India airline. I forgot my baggage in the aircraft and there is absolutely no response from the airline. Have been waiting at the airport for an hour. They bluntly reply that they don't have any staff to pick up the bag and they can't do anything about it. I have never experienced such an unresponsive and cold attitude on behalf of airline staff. I don't think I will choose Air India flight again.
350,"Not Verified |  I booked the ticket for my parents from Assam to Bangalore via Kolkata as there were no direct flight available on the particular date and i booked it only on the basis of the waiting period which was very less compared to the other flights. However on the day the flight which was suppose to take off at 8:30 and reach Bengaluru by max 3pm on the same day took off at 11 from Assam which is understandable because it can get quite foggy during winter. But after reaching Kolkata there was no information or any message from the airline regarding the delayed flight to Bengaluru. My dad has a chronic kidney disease and its difficult to travel for long hour and moreover they are not frequent flyers. Not even a single staff from air India passed any kind of information and on enquiry they simply raised their eyebrow with that arrogant attitude. I wonder what they are so proud of I just wish i had their names. The airline completely forgot their customer. Such a terrible airline. There is more to it, so the flight was delayed from Kolkata to Bengaluru via Hyderabad again by LEGIT 11hr which was also unsure of. Finally they boarded the flight at 10:50pm and reached Bengaluru at 3pm. Overall these airline have the worst attitude towards their customer. "
351,"✅ Trip Verified |  Average airline with terrible customer service and unacceptable corporate behavior. Completely disgusted with my experience. After a year of chasing Air India for a refund due to a flight that they cancelled, I have yet to receive a single cent. I did not even find out about the cancellation until after I arrived to the airport and was informed at the check in counter. Apparently they tried to call me once and I didn't pick up. No email notification, nor text...nothing. Several emails went by without a response. For months I waited, repeatedly calling customer service, until I received an email saying they would only issue a refund when things returned ""to normalcy."" Now it has been 12 months. Half of the time you call their number, you will get a message saying it's the wrong number. The other half of the time it won't go through at all. When you finally reach them, you receive service from staff so incompetent it's obvious they were not even given basic training of how to look up information in their system. You feel sorry for them as they fumble around. I won't even blame the call center staff, as it's obvious the responsibility lies on the complete negligence of the Air India management to run an efficient operation. Why are airlines allowed to get away with this behavior? Any other business would have been shut down a long time ago. This is not a review of the flight experience itself, which is generally average, but if you can fly with a better airline, absolutely do it."
352,"✅ Trip Verified |  Every time there a bad experience with Air India. This time I’m flyng Amritsar from Delhi. I’m currently in flight right now and writing this review. Before this there was a huge line for boarding where before entering the craft they were taking the luggage as there no space for luggage in the craft. While asking the reason for that they were silent. As per my knowledge one baggage is allowed per person so how come all the space is full? No explanation at all. When the lady sent me further where the guy is putting a luggage tag got offended when I asked him why is this happening. Rude staff, bad experience as always."
353,✅ Trip Verified |  We were coming back to canada from india on 31 of December and we faced a lot of problems on the Delhi airport the staff of Air India was so unprofessional and rude. The staff didn’t even know what documents they are required to check. They don’t mention anything before you book the ticket that what documents they are going to ask from you on airport for just giving you the boarding pass. How can a marriage certificate is required to get your boarding pass. Moreover we did online check in and booked our seats but on the airport they are giving us separate seats. It is not possible to sit separately from your family for a flight of 15 hours and then if you tell them to solve the issue they don’t even listen to you. Travelling with Air India was our worst experience till now. I hope this review will taken into consideration and steps will be taken to make the service better in future.
354,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having flown with this airline for quite some time, it is for the first time I feel compelled to write a review which is essentially to highlight the zeal and enthusiasm of two Air India staff. Ruwan at the ticketing counter and Rohit at the boarding gate, had sparkle in their eyes, spring in their steps and an infectious smile while attending to all sorts of queries of passengers yet not letting the guard down in these Covid challenging times. There pro customers behaviour and keenness to take that extra step for our satisfaction and making us comfortable is praiseworthy. "
355,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked the return ticket ($ 682) for my mother-in-law in Dec 2019 for travel date on 29 Dec 2020. Firstly, they deducted the money but didn't send the ticket. After numerous calls they finally gave the duplicate itinerary. Later due to COVID-19, the flight was cancelled. After numerous calls to their Customer Confusion Number, I could not get single value for cancellation charges. I got values from $100 to $ 400. They also told that under Melbourne to Delhi flight we still need to pay extra $ 1300. Total ticket price was coming almost three times the normal fare with no guarantee of flights. I immediately booked ticket for my mother in law in charter flights for only $ 1095. I submitted request for cancellation of e-ticket on 24 Nov 2020 to the specified email but did not received any response. After numerous calls they finally said that I need to lodge a ticket and the helpdesk, the details for which is no where mentioned on the website. In their initial response they informed that I should wait for 3-4 weeks with no mention of amount which will be credited. I am still counting at 34 days with no sign of refund. Wish I had the clock used by Air India as mine seems to be ticking too fast."
356,"✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to Delhi with Air India. Worst airline ever. Short on meals. Short on right about everything. No coffee available, short on drinks. Terrible service. Screens onboard didn't work."
357,Not Verified |  Toronto to Amritsar. I was flying along with my husband and son. We mentioned our vegetarian meal while booking and we told the crew member as well about our meal option. But they gave us chicken. We asked to replace the food. They gave us new ones but didn’t even say sorry.
358,✅ Trip Verified |  Be very careful when booking flights through this carrier. If you happen to cancel the tickets due to unexpected reasons you will not get your funds back. I have been waiting for almost 31 days now and the cost of the tickets around 3000 USD is not being refunded by Air India. None of their call center folks will give a response. All call center employees will direct you to ecommerce.airindia email id. No response will come form that ID. How can one keep funds with them for services not provided.
359,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Kolkata. The flight was relatively sparse and check in was a breeze although at Bangalore airport the safety checks were at a higher level and the fares were quite reasonable which was good. The flight was on time and boarding started well in advance. The only thing that was an issue was the screen guards which were provided. I could not see anything with them on which didn't make sense because just a couple of months earlier, the screen guards were proper. So it must have been an exception. Landing also happened well ahead of schedule. At a time when all private carriers are trying to profit from this situation, Air India seems to be flying reliably during these times. Keep up the good work."
360,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Delhi. Worst airline, double regular fare, horrible seats, jittery flight and food terrible. The cabin crew would not offer a mask when the mask I was wearing snapped."
361,"Not Verified | Probably the worst airline I've ever flown, paid just over 1000€ for business Class only to be moved down to Economy just after boarding, when I asked why the flight Crew said that Business Class was overbooked by 1 person, even though the business Class was almost empty. The plane took off on time, My IFE was not working for the Entire flight, I had a meal served About 2 hours into the flight, but it was disgusting. Cabin crew were relatively friendly, I don't credit this to Air India, as Indians are relatively friendly. The made the flight a little bit better for me. Air India wouldn't refund because I still got to my destination Even though I didn't get the Class I paid for."
362,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked an Air India flight for the 23rd of June from Mumbai to Auckland and also had a confirmed ticket. And because of the Covid19 situation, After a lot of difficulty i found a domestic flight and flew from Bangalore to Mumbai to catch my flight. Unfortunately, i get to know they have rescheduled the flight to July 2nd after reaching there, and they didnt not bother to inform their passengers via mail or message about the same. They made me stand and wait for hours when i went to inquire and lied to me saying the flight had been cancelled and blamed it on the immigration. Many passengers like me who traveled to Mumbai, are stranded here and nowhere to go. Air India agreed it is their mistake and refused to provide any solution. Since we could not go out of the airport and had nowhere to go, we had to pay 9000rs per day and stay at the airport hotel for 9 days, total 72000rs (which was not affordable and we had to shell out all our savings). Air India has played with passengers emotions, made them waste lakhs of rupees, left them in helpless situations and separated them from families and left them alone to suffer. This is unacceptable and inhuman. Very rude staff at Air India counter in Mumbai."
363,Not Verified |  I was supposed to travel to india through Air India flight from Stockholm to Delhi and Delhi to Hyderabad on 24th july 2020. i booked the flights through supertravel site. Air India cancelled the flights and now they are asking me to cancel my booking so that they can get all the penalty money where i will end up getting back 5% of what i paid. Neither Super Travel nor Air India helping me to get back my refund. As per international airline policies i should get back 100% refund but they are pointing to each other so that they dont need to pay back my money. Both the companies has worst customer care service. They never help you but instead they force you to cancel. And Air India never responds to your mails
364,Not Verified |  Delhi to Ranchi. Air India customer service staff very poor communication and also don't reply quickly.  Very poor service provider and don't have any manner to Air India ground staff as well as call service center staff
365,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Bengaluru. The load factor was quite full. Departure and arrival was on time and the crew were active to ensure that passengers follow the rules and norms during this time. Again there was no food and beverages except water served. I was able to reach my destination safe securely and Air India is still happening to run flights, though their prices are higher than average. This crisis has shown a face of the airline that is otherwise not seen by the regular public."
366,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Delhi by Air India. Me and my partner had purchased tickets to go to our final destination but as there was no direct flights, we had to book the flight to our destination via Delhi. The booking process was smooth especially when you consider that during the covid-19 crisis, most carriers were busy cancelling flights,  however we noticed that Air India flights were operating and looking at the previous record of flights we decided to go ahead with them. The tickets were on the high side but in these times having an airline actually fly instead of cancelling the flight is a game changer. The boarding actually started well before the scheduled time and as there were lots of passengers flying, a Boeing 777 was used instead of the Airbus. There was no food on this flight and for those allotted the middle seats, we had to wear the PPE equipment provided by the airline. Departure and arrival were both on time. So bravo Air India for once again coming to the nations rescue not only during the Vande Bharat missions but also during these difficult times. My impression of Air India during this crisis has increased leaps and bounds."
367,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to visit India this month, my flight was booked from London to Kolkata as initially I was about to fly to UK and from there to India but due to this pandemic situation my flight from Auckland to London got cancelled and I received refunded by Airnz, I expressed my situation to Airindia as I will no longer be able to travel this year as New Zealand border for overseas travelling will be closed but they didn't show any empathy rather just juggled up with wrong information. First they said they will refund half of the money I paid on my flight ticket which would be considerable at this stage but now they confirmed I will get no refund at all? Is this called an ethical customer service? The whole world is going through a big crisis and everyone should be cooperative to one another but yet Air India still robbing people. "
368,"✅ Trip Verified |  Most unethical airline ever. I had a booking with delta but Air India is not letting other airlines operate, forcing ppl to book their flights at 3 times the cost. My original Delta flight is $693, Air India charged me $1450, plus I need to book two other connecting flights separately. The reason given is other airlines May assign middle seats, whereas Everyone has crossed out middle seats Except Air India. Also Air India has quoted travel rules that go against international laws. I’m stuck here since 3 months and out of funds, now they are robbing me of my last reserves. The last time I travelled, they had no counter in Toronto Pearson airport, no announcement, flight departed early, next day on the flight the toilet was so disgusting it was a slap in my face. Service, food, entertainment everything was on the same level as the toilet. I pledge to never travel by Air India."
369,Not Verified |  We book a flight to Diu from Mumbai and it was early morning 7.30 am flight so we reached the airport by 5.30 to know that the flight is cancelled and there was huge crowd for the same flight. No representative or any person from airline was available to answer the queries / questions by all customers. We had a baby along with us who is just 3 year old and there were other passengers with infants struggling to know why the flight was cancelled. While i am writing this till that time we have not received any cancellation message or email. Pathetic service and highly not recommended to fly via this airline. If the airline does not send me any email or message i dont know if my money will come back or its donated to the airline. Please please don't go by this airline at all.
370,Not Verified |  I booked this airline for my parents to travel to India. The flight date is 27th May. The Airline canceled the flight due to COVID-19 and is giving us two bad options 1) Rebook the ticket and the travel has to finish before 31 Mar 2021. My parents can only go there during summer vacation. This summer vacation is gone... not enough time to rebook for the next summer. 2) Cancel the ticket and cancellation charges are $350/person. I asked can I just not show up and cancel the flight in June and the representative only mentioned that the cancellation charges then would be different but could not tell me how much different ... lower/higher/same/similar. So I'm paying $700 to AirIndia for canceling the flight on me and offering no reasonable alternative. Needless to say I had to wait a really long time on the customer service call. My queue position during the call went from over 90 to 11 to 15 to 19 and 17 and then I suddenly got a call. I have no clue why they bothered to even have a queue on the call. Their chatbot or automated service does not really work.
371,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Ahmedabad via Delhi, we booked for this May 2020 and again we are very disappointed. Due to this Coronavirus we want to cancel our tickets which we have on May 18,2020. As we live in Illinois we have lock down till May 30 2020 and so do india till May 17, but still they told us for cancellation for our tickets they will charge 400$ per ticket which is pathetic. I paid 800$ for whole ticket and I want to fly, but due to lock down they are not flying any flights still they wants to charge me 400$ per ticket for cancellation."
372,"Not Verified |  Toronto to Ahmadabad via Delhi. This airline is charging $525 CAD cancellation fees for cancelling flights during the COVID-19 situation. People around the world are in isolation. International travelers are being put quarantine. None of the International Consulates are operating in India. Is this airlines expecting people to travel in these circumstances? Customer care number was also declining calls, calls were getting dropped after getting picked up after being in the queue for a long time."
373,"Not Verified |  This airline is charging $400 cancellation fees for cancelling flights during the COVID-19 situation. People around the world are in isolation. International travelers are being put quarantine. None of the International Consulates are operating in India.  Is this airlines expecting people to travel in these circumstances? Customer care number was also declining calls, calls were getting dropped after getting picked up after being in the queue for a long time. They don't respond to emails."
374,"✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Hyderabad. My ticket was booked for 16th April 2020, and suddenly Air India has stopped its bookings. No information was given about the tickets that are already booked. I've tried calling the airlines but none of the contacts was ready to take the calls. It seems to be very irresponsible being the biggest carrier. Even the official site of the airlines is also incomplete without any information."
375,✅ Trip Verified | New Delhi to Bangkok. Ticket had been bought the day before from an airport agent. Check-in was quick and straightforward. The queue was very short. Boarding was uncomplicated and efficient. The flight took off and landed on time. I asked for and received an exit row seat. The seat was reasonably comfortable and there was plenty of leg room. Dinner was served about an hour after take off. I declined the meal because I had eaten in the terminal but from what I saw it seemed to be OK. I wanted to rest so I did not try the IFE. Baggage was waiting for me on arrival at the belt because I had an excessive delay getting medical clearance for Bangkok.
376,✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Delhi. Anyone reading this review please please save yourself by not booking with this airline. Booking system to the website to the customer service is very poor. Imagine you call them and they disconnect phone after waiting for 2 hours and call centre had no clue how to resolve queries. what a third-rated airline. Due to the Corona Virus where all good airlines offered a refund or full credit and longer exchange dates but Air India choose to mint money. Bunch of greedy jokers. Please pay a bit extra and use a different airline and you will thank me later.
377,"✅ Trip Verified | Due to bad weather my flight couldn't land at the final destination and was diverted to another city. No basic assistance was offered to any passenger, and long story short, we slept at the airport and arrived at the final destination 24h later than the original ETA. A flight compensation, refund, or cancelation report was refused to all passengers. If I was Indian, I would feel ashamed of having such a rubbish company representing my country and my flag. Next time I will spend 30$ more to fly with any other airline."
378,"Not Verified | Delhi to Melbourne. Not a good 12-13 hour flight. No entertainment, no footrest, no window shade (button missing with tape over) unserviced washrooms with broken panels - this is the scenario after delayed take-off and no announcements. Only 2 staff for an almost full cabin so no smile or attention there. The food is only a choice of vegetarian or non-vegetarian; both Indian and spicy - even the one we were woken for at 3 am! For this we were charged $1600 one way, which reduced the next day to $1100! Obviously taking advantage of people needing to get home before the curfew then when plane was fully booked, making the price appear more reasonable. The only way this airline could be surviving is because they have non stop flights between destinations that no one else services. Terrible."
379,"✅ Trip Verified |  Paris to Chennai via Delhi. Worst airline ever. This is the first and last time I'll travel with Air India. I just couldn't believe it. The plane was worst than a low-cost.  The seats were torn, arm rest not working, service very limited (foil paper on the plates), toilet not flushing, taps not working, stinks, headphones not working, entertainment poor. I will never travel by this airline again."
380,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Delhi. Worst airline ever. Old and dirty aircraft, bad food and the worst of all is the customer service. If you need it they will leave you for hours and hours waiting in the phone, and of course you have to pay for it, it's not a free call. Then if you are lucky and they pick up the phone, after several hours, then the nightmare starts, they pass you from one agent to other to finally hang out or just put you again up to waiting calls, no giving answers, not giving solutions. Now in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, they don't care about customers. And another nice detail is they can change your flight when they like, as many times as they like just by sending you an email. Never use it, you will regret it."
381,✅ Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to Mumbai via Delhi. Was struck by the filthiness and age of the airplanes of Air India. Boeing 787's aren't that old but airplane felt 20 years old. Dirty and worn down. Food was very poor and I ended up not eating at all to be honest. Cabin crew was OK but not especially friendly. Booked emergency exit row so had LOTS of leg space which I think helped. Uneventful trip overall. Delhi-Mumbai leg was flown with a Boeing 747 that actually WAS 20 years old. Worn out and dirty. But good legspace also in economy and we were served snacks and drinks on this 2 hour flight. Landed a bit delayed and was 1 hour late out of Delhi. Enforced priority boarding on both flight (I am Star Gold) which is appreciated. Overall OK airline a good value for money. Only airline flying directly from Scandinavia to India so a good choice.
382,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to London Heathrow. Always delayed. Terribly old and tatty planes. Seats are expensive, but what you get for your money makes no sense. Broken seats, arm rests, media units etc. Staff do not care, as they are used to having the same comments from passengers daily. Won't use them again."
383,"✅ Trip Verified |  Surat to Delhi. Its a worst airline I ever had. The flight was delay by 1 hour and we got notification and once we reach the airport they told it is delayed by 3 hours and because of that I missed my connecting flight. And when I went to talk to the Air India airport staff, One of the member told that they can't do anything as their responsibility is to transfer the passenger from one city to other. They don't care about the time and they are not afraid of anyone if we file a complain. As I asked for compensation, they told me that ""it's my fault that I booked a flight from Air India, So they will not help me for new tickets or not give any compensation."" They should learn some manners as they were really rude and they are not ready to help at all. I am personally saying, never fly with Air India. Worst Airline and worst staff ."
384,"Not Verified |  Toronto to Delhi. We had the worst experience. To start with the flight was delayed by 1:30 hour from Toronto, followed by the entertainment not working on the seat assigned, issue was raised to the flight personnel multiple times with no action or resolution provided. After 5 hours demanded to speak to supervisor who did not have any kind of explanation to it, we asked for a change of seat which was refused as well, we did fill a feedback form and no one has replied back on the same. The flight was more than half empty in first and business class and they should have the least provided us to change seats, the airline representative themselves blamed the airline and said this is what it is deal with it. The supervisor even mentioned that entertainment is not a part of the price paid so deal with it."
385,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Bengaluru. My flight was at 19:25 and so I left my home at 17:00 and reached the airport at 17:45 and there when I checked in using self check-in machine. It gave me error that contact service agent and so I went to the check-in counter and there lady sitting told me that your flight has been changed., I thought that seat of whole passenger of flight is changed and she gave me ticket of another aircraft (AI 547) which has to take off at 21:00. And then I saw display board and my flight was on time and then nobody changed my flight back to 19:25 giving reason that your baggage is already loaded and it will take time to get it back. Very bad experience.  Still I am waiting for my flight here on terminal 3 of New Delhi and the time is 18:47."
386,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Delhi to Thiruvananthapuran. We had checked in on line and paid for extra leg room seats 11E and 11F. When we arrived at the airport the departure board showed that we needed to check our baggage at desk G. When we went to the queue we were told to go desk F,which we did under the sign that said checked baggage only. However the display clearly stated that this row was for international flights and when we queried this with at least a further Air India staff, they all said the same thing. The queue was long and slow and we appeared to be the only non Indian people in the queue. It just didn't seem right, so I went back the the first person who had directed me from desk G to F who then amazingly said I should go the desk G. I refused to do this and insisted that she check me in. She just glared at me and it was only I complained to her colleague that they agreed top do this. After a lot of muttering between them that printed tickets for seats 27A and 27B. I pointed out that I had paid for 11E and 11F, and again after further muttering a dirty looks I eventually got thje right seats. At no time did they apologise or make eye contact. This is the worst treatment we have had from any airline."
387,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Mumbai. The check-in  process is a disaster, a member of staff was untrained and took to long to check me in. As soon as I was inside the airport, I've got a message mentioned that my flight was delayed for almost 3 hours, completely unacceptable."
388,✅ Trip Verified |  We were supposed to board the flight from Bangalore to Male at 1.50 pm on Feb 20th 2019. As I write this review time is 9.45 pm and we are still waiting for Cabin Crew. What a laughable reason. Staff and Air India team is irresponsible. This is terrible experience. 
389,"✅ Trip Verified | I flew on Feb 15 from Amritsar to New York via Delhi by Air India flight 101. my seat was 45H, audio input was broken and I can't hear anything. The 15 hours flight was so boring."
390,"✅ Trip Verified |  Agartala to Kolkata. I was traveling with my elder sister who is more than 70 years old. The airline staff were really caring and helpful in the entire process of check in, boarding, deboarding, and luggage collection. They took special care to arrange equipment so that my sister can easily reach her seat. Actually, she was not able to use stair to reach her seat."
391,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Raipur via Jharsuguda. Although for Raipur it was an one-stop early morning flight, I selected for a very low cost. The flight was clean and leg space was sufficient. They served a puff and sandwich for short flights. However, the cons of the flight are all passengers traveling to Raipur need to deboard at Jharsuguda, did the security, and reboard. As the same aircraft is going to Raipur, the airline may reduce passengers' pain by checking the boarding pass within the flight or at least just at the outside of the aircraft."
392,"✅ Trip Verified |  On time departure, nice in flight entertainment. Good meal, drinks on board and co-operative staff. Slept for more than 5 hours out of 8 hrs of journey.  I had flown Air India around 10 times mostly domestic. "
393,✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Milan. Onboard screens not working for most passenger. Controls for cabin windows did not work (nobody could sleep) 1 hour delay for 1 trip 30 minutes delay for return trip. Food intoxication on first trip. Do not fly with this company.
394,✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bangalore. The only airline I would never fly with again. They were so rude and incompetent. It took long at security check for which we got late for 2 min. and at that time the crew who was scanning the boarding pass before aerobridge doesn't consider us and for which we requested a lot and the lady from CRPF told to have a word with captain but she denied and was giving a reason and after that she took the pcm and went to flight to handover to pilot. It was a worst experience with Air India and in future will never fly with this airline. Unprofessional Ground staff.
395,Not Verified |  Delhi to Sydney. Worst flight I've ever experienced. The seats were so uncomfortable. The food was mediocre and the entertainment system stopped working 6 hours into the 13 hour flight. No flight attendant was able to fix it. Such a disgraceful service. Never again would I fly Air India.
396,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Delhi. A perfect flight. This was the first domestic flight that I have taken with Air India. As I have not had a favorable experience on their international service, I was not expecting much. The flight took of on time with pleasant flight attendants. On this 1.5 hour flight, they served a delicous dinner with remarkable efficiency. Contrast that with 5 hour flights across North America where we only get pretzels! The flight landed 10 minutes. All in all, it was really a perfect flight as I had no negative issues at all. Everything was really as it should be. Well done Air India!"
397,Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Bombay via Bangalore. The worst flight experience. Both flights delayed. The baggage arrived super late and the second flight boarded us which is already late by 2 hours. Very irritated except for the extra baggage because of which we booked this flight nothing is even near to good. Please don't make a mistake of booking this airline specially for international trips!
398,"✅ Trip Verified | Was travelling for an interview from Mumbai to Delhi, the company had booked it because it was the cheapest morning flight. The check-in process was smooth at BOM - the first time I have been able to print a boarding pass at an airport while flying Air India. The gate staff and the cabin crew were uninterested, but not unpleasant either. The food was good South Indian fare. The flight left Mumbai and arrived at Delhi on time. Was pretty uneventful, and was fairly inexpensive, considering that it was bought at the last monent."
399,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. Air India is a terrible airline. They lost my luggage first which was recovered after a week. Then the airline suggested me to go pick my luggage from Amritsar airport and was promised that i will get paid the cab fare. When i reached there the official there told me different story that we cant pay you then I called delhi airport and told my side of story and they gave me one email id and asked me to email there and promised me to solve my problem quickly. Its been more than a month they have stopped picking my calls and nit even responding to my emails. 
400,"✅ Trip Verified |  
What a pathetic airline company! They announced that there was a massive delay of 6 hours just a couple of hours before I left for the flight and had no announcement other than a cryptic email that they sent. There were no instructions on the flight or at the airport, they did not provide lounge access. They offered me snacks in return for the 6 hour delay. I'd never recommend this airline. I'd requested a special meal and they did not even provide it adding insult to injury. The air hostess said she would look into it and get back and never did."
401,✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Cochin via Delhi. Overall this company and staff are joke. My flight from Toronto was 11 hours delayed. Then the next flight which I was supposed to be on apparently was full. Waited for 19 hours at a hotel full of roaches. The next connection flight after 19 hours delay (6 hours wait was expected) then was further delayed for 2 more hours. The staff says its totally normal. They promises a lot to avoid you from counter when they dont have an answer. 0/5 rating. 
402,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to New Delhi. The flight experience was terrible. Staff was not friendly and was very rude. Service was not good at all.food was terribleIt was a very bad and horrible experience of our lives.
403,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Mumbai. My seat was rather old, as this was an older 777, and the wear and tear was evident. The tray table was rather dirty, and I had pointed this out to the flight attendant. She did so promptly. The guy behind me was very upset, as he said that his seat was falling apart. They moved him to another seat. The food was good. However, I am concerned about the state of the aircraft. Also, I am disappointed that the crew did not control the passengers when it was time to disembark. The aircraft was not even at the gate, yet passengers were all up and opening the overhead bins. Not a pretty sight! "
404,"✅ Trip Verified |  Colombo to Vienna via Delhi. Air India was by far one of the worst airlines, I flew with. It was a more or less cheap flight, so the food and drinks were ok, though the breakfast was not edible in my opinion (some sort of croissant with cream cheese and ketchup?). The staff was very unfriendly. When you asked for something, like a glass of water or some help with the screen in front of you, which didn't work at all, or froze in the middle of a film, they helped unwillingly. During the return flight to Delhi, we had 2 hours delay, we said to the staff before boarding that we had a transfer flight to Vienna and we couldn't miss it. They said, that they would take care of it, but they didn't! So in total 12 people missed the transfer flight and had to wait 24 hours in the Delhi airport until the next flight. They provided dinner and breakfast at one specific restaurant, but didn't organize any accommodations, nor did they give us any care products or blankets to sleep (let me tell you, it's very cold and loud in the Delhi airport). I don't recommend this airline, they treated us very poorly and we didn't get any compensation for the LONG wait."
405,"Not Verified |  My family had a very good flight from Melbourne to Delhi. Being in business class helped. The check in and boarding was fine. Surprise to receive a very good amenities kit and PJ’s. The aircraft was clean as were the toilets. Seating was excellent. However the service and food (Breakfast, lunch and a snack) was not up to the standard of QF,SQ & CX. Once the meal service was finished didn’t see the hostess. Limited choice of movies but nowadays most have their own downloaded on tablets. Overall it was acceptable and looking forward to our return flight."
406,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Hyderabad. I have not received my luggage after 1 day and no one is even replying on the baggage enquiry numbers. Is this the way government airlines work. I will never take this airline moving forward. Also, this seems to be my biggest mistake. "
407,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Goa via Mumbai. My friend and I bought our tickets in June and were due to fly November 16th. We had received a booking confirmation from Air India so thought all was well. When we arrived at the airport we were abruptly told there had been a system error and that there was no seat for us on the plane which was fully booked. I wrote a letter asking for compensation on November 26 and sent a email a week later. Neither the letter or the mail were acknowledged. I have also tried to telephone but no luck there either. The phone is either not answered or I am passed from one person to the next before silence. I am a frequent international traveller and have never encountered such a problem. We missed a holiday we were very much looking forward to and are most disappointed.
408,Not Verified |  Air India is the worst airline that I have ever seen in last 35 years. I was travelling from San Francisco (184 )to Indore in a connecting flight via new Delhi. I had terrible experience. Poor service on a long flight. Water was dripping over my head on the flight from San Francisco to Delhi.  My baggage was cleared after proper weighing in San Francisco. When I was transferring my baggage at Delhi airport for Delhi-Indore flight I was harrassed that baggage weight was different and I was forced to shuffle my stuff and throw out. They say we do not allow more than 4 kg laptop bag In spite of knowing that my laptop itself was 4 kg and there was charging cord and bag weight which they refused to allow.  I removed everything including charger from the bag. The staff at Delhi was very rude.
409,✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Agartala. It was a pathetic experience. None of the crew helped a bit to reduce the problems. No food was served. Worst flight experience of my life. Only one point for the time less time of flight Couldn't have taken it if it was a long flight.
410,Not Verified |  Delhi to Lucknow. We tried to web check-in twice but unable to do so and we were advised to contact at airport. At airport too there was some problem at the counter and the officer requested us to go to a particular counter where we got the boarding passes but to our shock we were allocated seats in different rows and the officer on counter told us that it happened due to failed attempts of web check in. Anyway we proceeded towards gate no 29B as printed on it. When we reached on the designated gate we're shocked to see that no one was there. We're clueless but soon I received a call that your gate has been changed and now please report at gate no 34. We were finally boarded and reached Lucknow. As we're told in the plane we reached to belt no 2 to collect our checked-in baggage but another shock was waiting for us. We stood there for 10 minutes but couldn't find our baggage and soon there was display of Indigo flight number on belt 2. I took a chance and went to belt number 3 nearby and found my baggage on it while no display was available on belt number 3. All fellow passengers were frantically searching for their baggage. Finally when we arrived our home the last shock we had there. 
411,✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Kathmandu. Exceptional Customer service from one of the crew member Arif. My flight was cancelled due to late arrival. But he handled the situation and helped me checking to the new flight. He is good in developing rapport with the customer. 
412,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Dhaka. The check in staff were by far the most unfriendly and uncooperative group of people I've come across. I travel a lot, and have always been assisted by airline staff in case of luggage weight issues and so on. However, Air India proved why they're one of the least preferred airlines in the industry. Never flying again."
413,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very bad customer service! I had booked two tickets from Bengaluru to Bhubneshwar for 22nd December, the amount for the same i.e. INR 10630 was deducted from my account but tickets were not confirmed. I spoke to the customer executive of Air India regarding the issue and she said that the ticket has not been booked and I will get refund for the same if I will mail to [email protected]. The customer executive also asked me to book the tickets again since ticket was not confirmed. Now, I have already booked another ticket through a different airline and I receive the trailed mail confirming my earlier booking. It has been so many days but they have not replied for my email, customer executive has not given any solution on call."
414,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. The experience is positive, staff is helpful, the airport is clean. The signs (for directions) are clear, making it easier to manoeuvre the huge airport."
415,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. Air India has the worst customer service ever. They lost my child's pram and when I complained at the airport, all they did was send me from one desk to another. I also tried to contact their customer service and again I was transferred from department to department. If they cannot help you, they will keep you on hold and disconnect your call. The staff is lazy, if you can avoid flying with Air India, do so. if I had the option of giving them minus, I would give them minus 10."
416,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. Never had that kind of bad travel experience. Missed flight to Toronto because flight was delayed 3 hrs at Delhi airport without any notice. Then waited for next flight at Mumbai airport for 36 hrs with my family. Hotel was not provided for first 13 hrs, slept on floor. Then finally after 36 hrs wait ready for next arranged flight to London and from London to Calgary. Again flight from Mumbai to London delayed and missed connecting flight to Calgary. Staff did not listen anything, no compensation, rude behavior. Worst nightmare of the life. And top of that there is no option to complain."
417,✅ Trip Verified |  Muscat to Delhi. Everything's great and it's so cost efficient. I don't expect luxuries but they are never on time. I have missed my train today because of 3 hour delay in my flight.
418,Not Verified |  London to Goa via Mumbai. The first thing they didn't tried to give us seats together. The flight was so dirty and the whole system was not working. There was no reply from the air host as the buttons of the call were not working and nobody was bothered to come and attend. They delayed the flight for 4 hrs from London to Mumbai. Once reaching Mumbai at 6 am we already waited for another delayed flight to Goa by 10.45. They neither providing us breakfast or anything. Very pathetic service.
419,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Frankfurt with Air India. No safety briefing whatsoever, but who cares anyhow. No information, advice, attention outside of two meals in 9 hrs flight, although flight was delayed by 2 hours. Cabin lights were kept off/low during day flight. It was just annoying and a bit depressing."
420,"✅ Trip Verified | Goa to Mumbai with Air India. The check-in process was efficient and courteous and the onboard service was friendly. The seats had plenty of legroom and a small snack was served. However, the flight operated 90 mins late, and the plane's interior was rather tired and even a bit grimy around the overhead light panel. Overall a pleasant experience because of the relaxed service, but Indigo is more efficient."
421,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Delhi. Worst experience I booked my ticket one day earlier because there was an emergency back at home. My flight was delayed by 6 hours. I kept requesting the transfer staff to help me but no one responded. I called the Air India office in Singapore but no one answered. Its worse than a budget airline.  Worst staff, worst management."
422,"✅ Trip Verified |  Udaipur to London via Delhi. Arriving at Heathrow flying out on the 2 Nov 2019 we found the seat reservations that were booked in April had not been processed and our seats were not available. We had to waste time at the Air India desk getting alternative seats and ensuring the rest of our bookings were in place. Onboard the outbound flight two of the toilets nearest us were out of use as were two out of the three entertainment systems in our block of seats (in fact one was completely missing). After some time and having been re-booted the other system was back in action. The on-board staff were courteous and helpful, seats comfortable (we paid for the emergency seats with lots of space in front) and the food was ok but only choice was eat it or starve. Basically the same can be said for the return flights adding that the flight from Udaipur was nearly two hours late without any explanation. Don't expect too much from this company (especially if you fly economy) and you won't be disappointed."
423,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Mumbai. The backrest was too short. I measure 190cm and head rest - the foldable ones - protrudes into where my shoulder is. Also, this way I have no head rest at all. Very annoying."
424,"Not Verified |  Birmingham to Amritsar. The staff at Amritsar were polite. The IFE screens were not working, the screens seemed to be falling off. The staff reset the screens, this did not help, armrests appeared to be falling off. The staff should regularly check that toilets are clean. On my flight the sink was blocked and there was no hand tissues or toilet paper."
425,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Kochi. Zero for time punctuality. Very casual approach in customer dealing. There is no one who can take action on non performing staff, it is the reason due to which Air India is making a loss in spite of having great potential. But no one cares - its taxpayer's money. I along with my spouse and two kids traveled through from Kochi to Mumbai on 03/11/19. Scheduled flight departure time was 8.10 p.m. from Kochi but the flight was delayed initially by 40 minutes than by 1 hour 20 minutes and finally took off at 10 p.m. with a delay of 1 h 50 minutes, and due to which I missed my pre-booked train from Mumbai to Vadodara. I had a similar experience during my earlier flight which I took from Mumbai to Trivendram on 26/10/2019. The flight was unnecessarily got delayed just because crew members did not arrive on time. When I claimed for train fare, I received terrible reply ""The flight AI-055 of 03 Nov 2019 was delayed on account of the late arrival of the incoming aircraft from Mumbai and the delay was unexpected and unavoidable. Our responsibility is limited to carrying you from Cochin to Mumbai as per purchased ticket only and so we are not in a position to provide any other compensation."""
426,"✅ Trip Verified | Colombo to Mumbai. Cancelling an international flight 9 days before departure because you don’t pay your fuel bills? Air India you are officially the worst airline I have flown on. And I have flown on a lot. Every time I fly with you you are a complete disaster. Frequent flight delays of hours, missed connecting flights, chaotic check-in with endless queues, terrible service. Never again."
427,✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Amritsar via Delhi. The worst flight I have ever had. Screens were not working. Arm rest was falling apart. Usb port not working at all. Washroom was not even clean. Recommendation to other passengers this flight does not value your money or satisfaction
428,"Not Verified |  Kathmandu to London via Delhi. This was my first time flying with this airline, and it will be the last. Both flights were delayed by hours, and no one took the time to provide any explanation as to why, or any apology for the inconvenience. The flight from Kathmandu to Delhi was delayed by 2 hours, and when it came to finally boarding the aircraft there was another security check of bags before you walked up the steps to the plane, it felt really disorganised and unusual given we had already gone through security. It almost puts doubts in your mind as if they don't trust the airports security process. When we got on the plane, the air hostess was rude and demanded I put my bag in the overhead locker despite just taking my seat and organising what I needed out of my bag. The food was not nice, and the plane was quite dirty. We were recommended this airline by a family member, I'm not sure if standards have dropped over the years, but it certainly was not up to ours given the air fare. We will not be recommending or using this airline again."
429,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seoul to Bangalore via Delhi. From the moment I entered till I got out of the plane, the whole 8 hour journey was unbearable with that strong, thick curry smell. Other passengers too were clearly uncomfortable and wore masks the entire flight.  Flight attendants don’t show up at multiple calls. Plus, the cabin crew were loud and you call that in-flight entertainment? By far the worst international airline experience. Canceling my return flight. "
430,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. Check in took over 2hrs in a queue as other late arriving customers for other Air India flights were rushed in front. Rude customer service. Our flight delayed by 3hrs due to technical problem? (2.50am in the morning). Inflight poor service, they rush pass you as you don't exist. Not a clean maintained flight, lost luggage and still awaiting for the update. Worst flight experience ever, will never fly Air India again."
431,"Not Verified | Newark to Mumbai. This 16 odd flight was really as bad as it can be. (1) There were no blankets supplied in most of the economy. When asked the flight attended simply said “We are sorry we ran out. When the ground crew said they only had used blankets from prior flight we refused for your safety”. (2) the in-flight entertainment system was broken and attendants simply said: “sir this is an old aircraft so many are broken - too bad”. Many “low class” customers travel in the Middle East / India sector and don’t know how to use the system and end up breaking it”. (3) food. I traveled by Air India many times and their saving grace was always good food. But this time I noticed it was super frugal (just an entree and small piece of bread ). To understand all this I struck up a conversation with one of the attendants and learned some stunning truths. He said “ sir everyone in Air India is aware of the poor quality of aircraft, non-working in-flight entertainment systems etc. but don’t seem to care. In fact, we file a detailed report after each flight, citing customer grievances, key issues etc, but nobody that can impact the situation cares. Net, it is a leadership problem. There are no customer service metrics attached to senior operational leaders’ performance evaluations and hence the outcome, As long as India government subsidies with plum jobs, customers like me can refrain from using Air India but that will not matter at all as economic forces are not at play here, For those wondering, the fare between United Airlines and Air India for this same route was almost equal (United was actually $100 cheaper and Air China was 50% lower), so Air India does not have the proverbial price advantage. I also learnt 2 new aircraft were acquired for traveling public but later converted to Air Force One for political leaders. The older aircraft if used for fare paying public. The business model is unsustainable. In new India, will someone take notice?"
432,"Not Verified | Yesterday I was travelling to Delhi to Dubai via Cochin AI 933. On d way to Delhi to Cochin, I asked a crew member a blanket for my 3-year-old daughter as the temperature was very low because of the AC. Its a matter of shame that I was denied."
433,✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Rajkot via Delhi. I have tried this airline first time and now it was last time because there is no service available on plane. Nobody came when I wanted something on plane even though put the buzzer on. Plus flight attendant was so rude to me. Basically you won't get nothing once you served. I wouldn't recommend this airline next time. Plus I paid more than other airline.
434,✅ Trip Verified |  Colombo to Delhi. The ground staff and cabin crew were very courteous. The quality was ok but not great. The cabin crew was helpful and pleasant. No in-flight entertainment.
435,✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to  Visakhapatnam. This is the fourth time flight delayed I don't know why they are showing fake timings Every time I'm missing my train from Visakhapatnam. Not valuing customer time. Care less. I don't prefer air India for any journey.
436,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bangalore was a very smooth flight and I was surprised that the check in agent was happy to provide me with an exit row seat which showed that the load on the flight was on the lesser side.  A good breakfast of idli and pongal was provided which was hot and fresh. The cabin crew were very friendly and as I was seated at the exit door seat, they gave very clear instructions about emergency evacuation. It was pleasing to note that this time there was an airbridge to deboard from compared to the standard remote bay. The flight itself was good and comfortable. "
437,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently took a flight from New Delhi to Chicago and back and had contrasting experiences. On my flight to Chicago, the crew was excellent and extremely helpful and the  experience was quite comfortable, let down only by malfunctioning screens. On the other hand, my experience on the return flight from Chicago to New Delhi was really bad. Right from the unhelpful staff, to shoddy screens and toilets not working, spending those 14 hours was a nightmare. So, overall I still don't know whether to recommend Air India or not, only thing is fly only if that's the cheapest deal anyone is getting."
438,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked my 18.50 flight via agent from Pune to Delhi on 9th October. But they cancelled this flight and merged with 22.15 flight due to less passengers. This was not informed to me. My eticket message received to me on my contact no, but this flight cancellation message not received. I had to spent 4 hours on Pune airport doing nothing. Secondly I reached Delhi at 1 pm on 10th October. On Pune airport no staff available to take my complaint. They had treated us very badly. I was really disappointed with the treatment received during this incident. "
439,"✅ Trip Verified | 
I was travelling from Delhi to Bombay through Air India, AI665 on 16th October 2019 whose scheduled time is 8 am. It gets delayed (for no reason as there is no bad weather and no other flight of any other service provider gets delayed) for 1 hour and it's rescheduled time would be 9 am but the flight takes off at 9.40 which caused many inconveniences to many of us. I have a conference meeting in Thane Maharashtra at 12 noon and I got there after 1 pm which ruins my image. I request Air India to please take care of such types of inconvenience caused to passengers."
440,"✅ Trip Verified | Bengaluru to Mumbai. On this flight, even though the cabin was completely full, the flight departed and arrived on time. It was pleasing to note that the crew still made announcements during the safety demonstration and at other times instead of having that automated like the LCCs. It adds a personal touch. The breakfast was hot and filling and the overall attitude and demeanor of the crew was positive. One area which prevents them from getting a full rating was the fact that it was observed that the in-flight magazines were not placed in the seat pocket of each and every seat which perhaps should have been there. As on flights with a slightly longer duration, having something to read would have been really helpful. But compared to other airlines such as the LCCs, Air India provides a much better experience and service. The baggage was retrieved very quickly. Thank you for a comfortable flight."
441,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. Seats were not comfortable in fact broken. Screens were not working. Reading lights were not working. Crew was not helpful at all in fact they tried to be sarcastic and advise us to join them in kitchen and help them when we made complain that screen and lights are not working!! Very unprofessional attitude. Crew totally ignore customers by not answering to call buttons. They didn't even had biscuits on their flights. 
442,"Not Verified |  Delhi to Kathmandu. First impression the flight was delayed by an hour. Then we were told that the the gates had changed at the last moment so we had to rush to another gate which was a chaos. After boarding still lots of passengers hadn’t taken their seats and were searching for it but no flight attendant came to help. Even when I hadn’t taken my seat the plane began pushing back from the gate. Then finally we took off and looking at the condition of the seats on board I didn’t even want to sit there. The seats had almost turned black. There was  no inflight entertainment except an old magazine from who knows when. The food was ridiculous, we got served minced meat with giant tomatoes in it and a bun served with a small bottle of water.I mean couldn’t they afford at lest a glass of coke? I had about 150g over baggage and they wouldn’t even let that through. They asked me to pay over baggage fees but instead I took out a packet of sweets from the bag and we were ready to go. "
443,"Not Verified | Delhi to Kathmandu. The plane was delayed by an hour. Then at the last moment we were told that our gate had changed. Then everyone had to rush to the new gate which was chaos. After boarding the plane lots of passengers hadn’t taken their seats. Many of them including me couldn’t find their seats and there was no flight attendants to help out. Then the plane began pushing back from the gate even when many of us were not seated and the flight attendants didn’t bother to help and took their seats instead. Finally, we took off after about a delay of one and a half hours. I was already not feeling that great about choosing air India and looking at the condition of the seats, began regretting choosing air India. The inflight meal was ridiculous. We were served minced meat with giant tomatoes on it with a small bottle of water. The inflight entertainment was none except an old magazine from who knows when. Oh yes almost forgot they don’t even allow an extra gram of excess baggage. I had 150g of excess baggage and they wouldn’t even let me through for that. They asked me to pay excess baggage fees but instead I took out the packet of chocolates instead. Then we were ready to go. Well, I personally recommend to not fly with Air India."
444,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Dubai. Arrived Delhi airport 3 hr before time, no row was showing on display for my flight,1st the ground staff said that check in in row E, that was too crowded, after spending 45 min in that queue come to know that I am in wrong check in area, again have to queue at another one for 45 minutes, then come to know that they had don't have any info about my selected seat which I paid for, after that 15 min at check in counter to short out the matter, later immigration in Delhi was as pathetic as mostly, reach boarding gate just at the time of boarding even after reaching Airport around 3 hr before. Flight was ok, food good, on time."
445,"Not Verified |  I travelled from Dubai to Cochin on Sept 22nd, take off time from Dubai is 13.35. May be Off season offer air India announce a baggage of cabin 40 kilo and hand 8 kg. But my cabin bag includes only 34.5 kg and my fate my hand bag just exceeds 500gms while they weighing in boarding and it shows 8.450 kg. But they imposed a penalty of 70 Aed at the boarding entrance. They were not ready to allow a single gram. And also inside the flight the cabin hostess behaviour also found to be too harsh. I never support air India flight for a long travel. Inflight entertainment the headset and screen is not working and I ask for a better service to the hostess she replied that Air India have this  facility only."
446,"✅ Trip Verified |  Varanasi to Delhi in August. Was travelling with only hand baggage so checked in using self checking kiosk. Boarding started on time, may be as it was just few days before Indian independence day, they took body and baggage search at boarding gate. Aircraft was just ok, need to improve cleanliness, seats were comfortable. Journey was just above one hour, they served complimentary snacks, paneer tikka served was good, no alcohol on domestic rule as per DGCA rule and only veg for economy for so called cost savings. Crew were ok. Overall not a bad airline when travelling domestic and ticket prices are at par other airlines."
447,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. Flew with Air India for the convenience of the direct flights. They were the same price as there competition, which we decided to use the National airline. We wish we never. The only positives are it’s direct and left on time. The plane was badly damaged on the inside. The clientele really don’t look after the planes. The seats were damaged or squeaky, the tray tables broke, netting to hold books iPad etc broke and then the toilets. They were gross. Worst toilets I’ve ever seen on an airline. Also in two that I went into the seat was broke and wouldn’t stay up on it’s own accord. The food was terrible. IFE was sufficient for the 8hours. The crew’s on board safety was awful. None of the safety checks were carried out when landing or taking off. I have to admit I was excited to Air India. But overall the experience was shocking."
448,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bengaluru. This was a comfortable early morning flight which took off on time and even though the flight was completely full, the flight attendants were quite nice and the breakfast service which consisted of a idli / poha was not rushed. Flight itself was very smooth and we landed also well enough. Kudos to the airline and the crew."
449,"✅ Trip Verified |  Travelled last week on Delhi to Dubai route. Actual departure time was 16:50 but got message/mail/call in morning that it has been rescheduled for 17:20,ok,good that they informed early through all possible means. At Delhi Air India have common check in desk for all international flights still at the time I reached wasn't much crowded, 15 min in queue and 2 minute at desk. Boarding started on time but no zone wise boarding, everyone was boarding same time. They had only one scanner machine for boarding pass scanning but there were 2 queue to board,complete chaos,not a decent boarding experience. Aircraft was Boeing 787-8, AirIndia has some of the best leg room for economy, interior was just ok, not looking fresh. It was just 3.5 hour flight, they started beverage service just half hour after flying, not a bad selection of beverages,after that dinner, option of veg,chicken or mutton, was ok but earlier on same route got better. Finally landed in Dubai in 2 hr 50 min, half an hour before schedule. Inflight entertainment need to be improved. Overall okay experience for the price I paid."
450,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Delhi route was on negative side. Check in :I was flying 1st time from Singapore, my wife had flight to DXB by Emirates few hours before my flight, they had fully automated self checking and was expecting same for Air India but I was wrong. Air India still use conventional method of checking. Boarding was on time. Aircraft was in shabby condition, needs serious maintenance, torn back pockets, damaged window light control and many more. Breakfast served was just Ok, didn't expect this on a route like SIN DEL.Flight crew was ok. On time:Arrived Delhi before time,that was good."
451,✅ Trip Verified | Bengaluru to Mumbai by Air India. The flight was slightly delayed by an hour or so due to crew work time limitations being exceeded but this was communicated well in advance and so there was also no adverse consequences as a result of that. The flight in itself was a very standard fare with breakfast served and the crew being fairly warm and receptive. Had it not been for the delay this would have been the perfect flight but nevertheless an enjoyable and comfortable flight experience. Also travelling on the Airbus A320 Neos is quite good as they are newer aircrafts and more fresh.
452,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. We had a 1 hour delay on the tarmac with non working air conditioning cabins and very minimum air venting at 40c temp in cabin . Were told by crew it would get better when we were airborne and while air vented a bit better when airborne it was still very warm. The staff knew Air Con had an issue and were told by numerous passengers even while on the tarmac but lied saying “air would be more once airborne”. Crew and Pilots obviously knew they had a fault, werent expecting to be on the Tarmac for an hour waiting for a delayed USA connection to this flight and flew with a fault anyway to keep schedule. "
453,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. Changed my flight to a different one and of an earlier time. Didn't bother informing even once. When I tried enquiring at the airport, they didn't find it important to reply to me for the same. Moreover, the flight's AC was having issues which again wasn't informed about. Hot and highly uncomfortable throughout the journey."
454,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Delhi via Hyderabad. This was the first time I was flying Air India, and I have truly never used a worse mode of transportation ever. Air India has the worst aircraft with the most ancient entertainment systems. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days. This experience has definitely turned my family, friends and me away from Air India as future customers."
455,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my ticket in the UK with Southall travel. 2 days before my outbound flight to Delhi I telephoned Air India to reserve my seats. I was told that I now had reserved window seats on every one of my flights and there was no need to check in online. It was all done. I arrived at Heathrow and took my pre booked window seat to Delhi. On 14th April arrived at Delhi international airport at 09:50 in the morning to fly to Kathmandu. The flight was due to leave at 12:50. 3 hours later. I queued with my luggage for almost 2 hours. When I got to the check in desk I was told that Air India had over booked the flight so I would not be able to fly that day and would have to fly the following day. I protested and said that this would not do. I spoke to several members of staff and two managers. I was pushed from pillar to post. I demanded that Air India put me on the next available flight with whichever carrier they could. I was told that this would not be possible as the only other flight to leave that day was a Nepal Airlines flight which was already full. I persisted. Finally they called Nepal Airlines who agreed to put me on the flight if there was a cancellation and the 2 airlines would sort out everything between themselves. While I was waiting I questioned the Air India representative who informed me that it happens quite regularly and that every week at least one or two passengers do not get their seats due to Air India over booking their flights. He said that confirming seats for my future Air India flights by telephone was not a guarantee that I would get the seat because priority would be given to people who book their seats online and if I ever was to confirm my seat by telephone then Air India's policy is to advise customers to arrive at the airport to check in at least 4 hours prior to departure. The agent in the UK said nothing about this when I confirmed my seats with him. A seat came up with Nepal Airlines at around 14:35. I was told to hurry forward. I did so do with the Air India representative towards the Nepal Airlines check in desks. However when we got there the Air India Representive informed me that I would be liable for the excess baggage as Nepal Airlines allow only 20 kilos of luggage whereas my luggage allowance with Air India is 46 kilos. I refused to pay; It was not my fault that Air India over booked their flight so why should I, the passenger be penalised for their utter incompetence. "
456,"✅ Trip Verified | We had a awful trip from FFM to Colombo and back with Air India. We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. It is a shame that they are a member of the Star Alliance group."
457,Not Verified |  Had booked Business class from Kathmandu to New Delhi. Without any notice Air India changed the flight to an all-economy flight. All staff were extremely rude and the only answer we got was - this happens sometimes. Got told to contact ground staff on arrival in New Delhi to get a refund. Ground Saff said I'm not eligible for a refund since I didn´t book my ticket with an Indian bank card. Worst customer service ever experienced from an airline. Will never use Air India again.
458,"✅ Trip Verified | 15th August I arrived in Dehradun with Air India AI 9609. But my luggage was missing. I made a complaint to the lost and found. Until today, the 18th of August they are not able to track the luggage. Air India staff are useless and so unprofessional. I will never recommend Air India to anyone."
459,"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Melbourne via Delhi. Pleasantly surprised by Air India Business Class. The cabin only has 18 comfortable seats which make excellent beds at the press of a control. The layout is 2x2x22 so you could be unlucky if travelling alone as not much privacy. Get an aisle seat for mobility. The food for main meals was delicious especially the vegetarian options. The drinks service was limited but all that is needed. The cabin crew on the long leg were kind and helpful, One elderly man took ill and they did everything they could to help him. The entertainment options are limited but the seat and bed are great value. Transfers at Delhi are slow and understaffed and need upgraded body screening equipment. I would fly business class with them again."
460,✅ Trip Verified |  Muscat to Madurai via Chennai. Worst flight service of India. Poor time maintenance and customer service. All the time it's late. Those who want to have a pleasant on time journey don't choose Air India.
461,"Not Verified |  Delhi to Chicago. Very bad staff at reservation counter. Also hopeless tickets allotment, all of us given 3 different spots - row 36, 42, 45. I had 3 yr kid with me they says talk to people in flight. My question why they ask age while booking? Can anyone be ok to keep 3 yr old without parent, They should have used age while pre-allocating tickets."
462,"Not Verified |  Birmingham to Kochi via Delhi. This was the worst flight I've been on. First of all it was a last minute decision to fly to India regarding a family emergency so we booked an inexpensive flight and that flight was air India. The staff were rude to us and the the tray table was filthy and had bits of dried up food stuck on it, when I reported this to the stuff they handed me a tissue asked me to it clean up. You could have at least cleaned up the aircraft for the passengers to use and I take this offensive because hygiene is important to me. Next when we reached Delhi we were told to collect our luggage from the luggage belt and load it on to the next flight because it was a domestic one, this was the first ever time any airline had asked us to collect our luggage when we hadn't even reached our destination. At first we weren't sure because we had flown before and this had never happened so I asked the people at the information desk for help, there wasn't anyone else there but for some apparent reason the people at the desk couldn't see me I said excuse me about three times before someone looked up from their phone and when they did they were unhelpful and they looked at me like how could I disturb them from they're phone's. All in all it was a horrible experience and I will never fly on this airline again."
463,"✅ Trip Verified |  New Delhi to Dubai and I had a great Flight. I would like to specially Mention a senior cabin crew, Sheetal. who was very kind and dedicated towards her job. Thank you for your hospitality."
464,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to Sydney via Delhi. First flight with this airline, and pleasantly surprised. Aircraft staff were friendly and attentive, food was great and wine free flowing. The seating style seems a little old fashioned, but provided for more comfortable sleeping as your leg positions aren’t as constrained as in the latest corral style business seats. Air India also provided crisp cotton covered quilts in addition to a lighter day blanket. On the Tel Aviv to Delhi leg we were offered pyjamas; perhaps we could have asked for them on the next leg. The staff at the lounge at Delhi was the only weak point. The lounge itself was well provisioned and well equipped, apart from the lack of a shower, but the woman at the desk was unhelpful to the point of rudeness."
465,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. My flight is for 27 December 2019. I have booked a Mumbai to Hong Kong flight - via Delhi and I am now trying to change the flight to a direct flight. I am just not able to do so. I called the call centre more than 3 times and every time my call lasted for about an hour. Crazy long waiting time, and still no solution. Every time, they take all details and just before the final change, the call disconnects and now when I call them, they are asking me to call tomorrow or maybe later. wow - what a solution. they also suggested that a call back can be arranged, but not today.. hahah. Are you serious? I have 11 tickets to be changed for my entire family members. All this happened today (23 July 2019)."
466,"Not Verified |  New York to Hyderabad via Delhi. The lack of customer caring and the rudeness was appalling. My last name changed when I got married therefore my new passport has my married name. For some reason they would not accept the passport and my marriage certificate as a proof of that. My Indian visa is on my maiden name. I tried to reason with them that the US government takes security seriously and that they issued my new passport, drivers license, social security card etc. only after verifying everything. The airline demanded that I produce a court document showing name change - I dont have a court document nor does any one that I know. That is not what we do in the US for marital name change. They refused to let me get on the airplane with this reason. I was literally travelling to India for two days to attend to a family emergency and I couldn't make it. The worst part is the way the Air India staff in JFK treated me. One would expect that they would try and help the passenger but the person incharge  was extremely rude and treated me like I was not human. I was literally in tears explaining to them that I have traveled like this before and no other airline objected. Like banging your head on a wall"
467,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Bengaluru by Air India. On this late afternoon flight to Bengaluru, the flight was on the lighter side and so, as a result, the check-in process was a breeze and boarding started well before the scheduled boarding time. A light snack was provided consisting of a savoury cake and samosas/pav bhaji and the portions were generous in quantity which was well appreciated. The crew was friendly and engaging which was good. The flight departed on time and arrived well before the scheduled arrival time which was a huge plus. Air India provides great value for money and they should keep it up."
468,"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Delhi. I had a family emergency, so I bought whatever ticket was available. Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line! I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck. I recommend everyone to avoid this airline like plague. I am never flying with them again."
469,"Not Verified |  Mumbai to Newark. Horrible experience ever had. My flight would fly on July 2nd at 1:30am, but they delayed 3 hours first then delayed for ove night 3rd July 2:30 and we did fly by 4 am, and it supposed to be direct flight but they  lay over at Ahmedabad airport for 4 hours and  told us for only 1 hour and half. We basically waited 25 hours on airport with no hotel accommodation. They didn’t provide water and blankets till we asked on 2nd July. 3rd July we argued with staff and manager and they agreed to give us lodge and food.  I would never fly again Air India and not recommend this airline ever."
470,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a local connecting flight from Hyderabad to Mumbai (scheduled departure for 10 PM and scheduled arrival for 11:30 AM) and then we had an international flight from Mumbai to Newark (scheduled departure 1:30 AM and arrival around 5 PM India time). Very bad communication skills with customers- For our Mumbai to Newark flight that was already delayed by 12 hours (it was scheduled for July 2nd 1:30 AM). We finally arrived in Mumbai around 10 AM. While the flight attendees were going through the security check, the Air India staff informed us that our flight to Newark would leave at 2:30.  Later on, the Air India staff told us that our flight would actually be leaving at 2:30 AM not PM. Not only is our original flight being delayed by 25 hours, but Air India did not correct its customers when they were continuously feeling relieved over false information.  As an airline, it is their duty to be clear to the customer as to when the flight is leaving and being clear with that information especially when they are aware the the flight attendees are on a consensus different from the fact. Horrible Service- In our first flight, from Hyderabad to Mumbai (left at 11:30 PM) , we flew all the way to Mumbai spent 1-2 hours in the air there and returned back to the Hyderabad airport at 3 AM because the flight had no place to land and apparently because of weather. Then, after we returned to the Hyderabad Airport, they kept us in the flight until 7:30 AM and at 7:30 AM we finally left for Mumbai and arrived at 9 AM. This means we stayed in an airplane for 6 hours when we should have only spent 1 and half hour in the plane for our flight. During this entire fiasco, the Air India staff only provided us with a biscuit packet with 2 biscuits and a lunch voucher that only worked during a horrible time. How is one lunch voucher and some biscuits suppose to last us for 17 and a half hours? "
471,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Mumbai. On this early morning flight, it was surprising to note that the check-in was a breeze and the flight was not  full. There was a hot breakfast provided which was of good quality. The flight attendants were attentive and looked after the safety and comfort of passengers.  Luggage was received swiftly without too much waiting. "
472,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to Newark. Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"". Wrote emails to all departments of Air India including the baggage department. Still waiting for a reply. It's been three days and I'm looking for the lost baggage for me and my parents who travelled to the US and sill have no response from Air India. Please save yourself all this trouble and choose any other decent airline over Air India (even if its a few hundred dollars more pricy)."
473,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Ahmedabad. Save yourself trouble and never fly Air India. I had a horrible experience with them twice when flying Economy which is why I stopped flying with them and picked Emirates instead. Unfortunately had to book a last-minute ticket and didnt have a choice. This time I hoped the experience will be better since I was flying Business. I am thankful that it was United who issued my tickets and were reliable enough to help me. Air India CS was a nightmare to deal with. Couldnt help. They couldnt find my record, they couldnt assign me a seat, they couldnt confirm anything. Not to mention I was on hold for an hour before they answered the phone. It was United Airlines who put in an hour to communicate with them and help re route me when my flight got cancelled."
474,"✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to New Delhi. Worst of the worst. Don’t fly Air India unless this is your only resort. 1) I was traveling alone with my twin 3 year old daughters. They offered no support during the flight. I smiled more than they did. 2) I asked the hostess for water upon boarding and she told me to look in the seat pockets. No such thing was found. The seats were in horrible condition when we arrived. No one had cleaned after the previous flight. 3) No inflight entertainment. Everything was broken. 4) Calling the hostess is a useless exercise. Don’t bother waiting. 5) The arm rests were broken and cracked dangerously enough to cause a hazard for little kids. They kept falling on them when they were trying to sleep. 6) They have nothing to offer little kids. No coloring sheets, stickers. Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving. When I complained, they simply said “You should’ve asked for it.” 8) When I whined about all this, one of the hostesses said that she’ll come and take a look. She never came."
475,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Hong Kong. Air India flight was supposed to take of at 11 pm IST on 15/06/19 but let us cook in the flight for some 3 hours while mending a technical fault in the aircraft. Then at 2 am the air craft becomes grounded & we are requested to deplane to board another aircraft. Further we are subjected to a security check a second time which also became a harassment as there was hardly any staff to speed up the unnecessary process. The small children had become very fussy by 3 am. Then we boarded the next flight running to the next opposite gate so that flight could now leave in a orderly fashion. But after 15 minutes an announcement was made that the pilots had to deplane because of some regulations. With no further explanations about the current situation, there’s an announcement plz open gate l2. At 5 am with much confusion people started deplaning the aircraft a second time only to surround the two ground staff for some kind of explanation. It was really shameful to explain to the foreigners who didn’t understand hindi that its okay for the National Carrier Of India to behave in such fashion. But my biggest challenge of the night was dealing with my own 3 year old who was so excited, didn’t sleep until 4am in the morning & was constantly asking ‘when’s the plane gonna fly, when do we get on our cruise?"
476,✅ Trip Verified |   Delhi to Mumbai. The worst baggage service and customer care which I have been ever seen. Please don't choose Air India which makes your journey and day of the journey and also entire trip as painful and stolen/broken luggage.
477,"✅ Trip Verified |  Colombo to Kathmandu via New Delhi. Horrible experience from the start till the end. There were multiple changes to the flight schedule which disrupted our travel plans and we were provided ridiculous alternatives (we are transiting in Delhi and the new flight meant that our connecting flight would depart Delhi even before we arrive in Delhi- how is it even possible for us to catch the flight if we arrive in Delhi at 11am and the flight to Kathmandu from Delhi departs at 9?). So after a gruelling process of speaking to an agent we are offered new flights. This time around we had a one hour transit in Delhi which most travellers would agree is cutting it thin if you consider queues and other unpredictable scenarios. But as luck would have it, our flight from Colombo was delayed by over 30 minutes. We were slated for an 8.20am departure according to the ticket but when we spoke to the staff they told us it has been pushed to 850am. That leaves us with 30 minutes to transit? How can we possibly disembark, go through security and get to our new gate in this time? To make things worse. At 840 people were still disembarking from the plane which appeared to be a turnaround flight. This meant that the staff would still have to clean up the plane and it was evident that our flight would not depart punctually at 850- but at this point no announcements were made whatsoever, not even on the notice screens. Upon checking with the staff they told us it would depart at 905 instead. What on earth is happening? All this while the staff insisted that I would be able to make the flight even though I initially had a one hour transit and the original flight has now been delayed over 45 minutes. That leaves us with 15 minutes. Rather than providing us with helpful information, they gave us flimsy assurance that we would make it even though the odds were clearly against us. This uncertainty is disconcerting for travellers who have actual plans that may need to be shelved if we actually miss the connecting flight. Air India needs to stop selling tickets they cannot guarantee and work on being on time. It makes no sense for a national carrier to be so flaky with their timing."
478,"✅ Trip Verified | I had a connecting flight with Air India from Amritsar to New Delhi. The airline changed the time of flight by three hours and interrupted the whole schedule. And then on contacting with airline customer service after 40 minutes of waiting on call, I have been advised that they can’t help me. Seriously they don’t understand what is the value of the customer."
479,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Chennai. I booked the ticket for my family (3+1 Infant), when my family entered the aircraft they had not provided the infant carrier & for my family also seats provided at the last row, which the seats did not have recline. The flight was to reach Chennai @ 05.00 am today, due to less fuel they landed in Bangalore airport & they said that we are landing in Bangalore due to bad weather condition in Chennai, during the filling of fuel they switched off the engine & AC, more than 1 hour. All passengers are suffocated due to no air supply after all passengers shout they opened the emergency exit, my family had to hold the baby until they reached Chennai. They reached Chennai @ 07.30 am."
480,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Sydney via Delhi. Happy with new aircraft, sad with Service.  No drinks provided on seat, no response of call light. Need to walk to kitchen and ask for my drink."
481,"Not Verified |  Varanasi to Amritsar via Delhi. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Staff had no intentions to help you. -My first flight was delayed and they only publish the new time and gate 15 minutes before boarding, which was frustrating.  My second flight was cancelled! Poor customer service, poor traveling experience, and very frustrating!"
482,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Chennai. I travelled in this airline, very disappointed. Poor service and very disorganized. Not worth for traveling in this. Just for one blanket need to ask few times. Next the seat can’t push back while sleeping. Seat number 14. In future for sure I will not take this flight. "
483,✅ Trip Verified |  Paris to Mumbai via Delhi. Air India sorry to say is the worst airline experience any can ever have. I was traveling with my son and to make it easier instead of 2 suitcases of 23kg each I chose to carry 1 suitcase of around 28kg. While going to Paris I travelled in Emirates with same luggage allowance and had smoothest check-in. But for my return flight they did not let me check in because I had one suitcase and asked me to either make it in two bags (which  I didn’t have on Paris airport) or pay for excess. Even on requesting and telling them I have 46kg combined allowance for both tickets on same PNR but they denied stating I have to pay if I am beyond 23kg or I need to find my solutions and come back to them for checking. The air hostesses in flight were least interested in service. The headphone of my seat and my neighbours weren’t working and even after multiple requests they never even for once got time in a 9 hour flight to change our headset and thus no entertainment for us. Our flight from Paris to Delhi gets delayed. After customs and immigration the luggage drop off counter is a small crowded counter. No proper queues and Officers are the most rude people you will encounter. They at the last moment before dropping our luggage asked us to check in the liquor bought on duty free. We had to take out clothes from our bag and put bottles inside on the counter which was badly crowded and unprofessionally managed. Upon arrival in Mumbai after almost 15-18 hours and waiting for almost 40 mins for our luggage we are told that our baggage is left in Delhi and will come in the evening flight and will be delivered only after 1:00Am. On telling them that this delivery time is not acceptable they day they can only deliver that time or next day but when we told them there wont be anyone at home as we will be at office. The executive there told me that its my problem not hers. In all this was the worst experience in terms of an airline I can ever had. 
484,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Delhi. I booked this flight in February for June flight - unfortunately there was bad experience with me. Third class food, and  the baggage service very poor - they lost my bag at Delhi airport and they didn’t pick my call and then 4-5 days after they said I have to come airport again and pick up my bag - I am living 600 km away from airport. i would never recommend to anyone this airline."
485,"✅ Trip Verified |  I made a reservation Amritsar to Mumbai for 3 passengers with Air India. They deduct the total amount of my credit card but any booking confirmation came. I call them, email them etc etc. and till today I still have no answer .. except that they are verifying. I gave them the approval number for the credit card (that my credit card customer care gave me), but even with that info they are unable to help. "
486,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Ahmedabad via Delhi. Wish there was option for no star at all. Air India  definitely deserve that at this point. My mom had flight to go India for June 7,2019. and the flight was early departure and no notification was sent. Now my mom has call all her relatives that she will not be able to make it to the wedding that she has been planning for months. It might be her last time she gets to see her family. Thank you to air India for taking that away for her. "
487,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dimapur to Kolkata. We didn’t get the seats we purchased in advance (seat 02A & 02B, AI 710). We were given seats way at the back! After consulting the Dimapur AI booking staff, they realized the error and cited a “different aircraft.” Shortly before take off, a ground staff came to where we were already comfortably seated and invited us sit in the “business class” since the seats were empty and because we didn’t get our preferred seats (with payment). But our nightmare was just beginning! We were badly insulted on flight by two attendants. After the flight took off, these two attendants raised a tantrum saying they were not informed and forced us back to the seats where we were previously comfortably seated. They blamed the ground staff for this misunderstanding. We felt harassed and embarrassed. We are still shocked at such lack of coordination.  The pathetic service of Air India is a living nightmare. The payment for seats hasn’t been reimbursed either."
488,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Calicut. Ridiculous service. More than 2 hours queue for check in; air India employee let all passengers who were saying they were late to jump the queue, causing delays also for people who were there more than 2 hours before. The employee at the check in let some passengers not pay for extra weight luggage while other (such as me) had to pay (which is of course correct, but the treatment should be the same for everyone); moreover to pay I had to make another queue; they make fun of me because at the end of this queue they told me it was not correct so I have to come back to previous queue, where thanks to the kindness of other passengers I could have reached the desk faster, otherwise I would have lost my flight, so that just for check in, it took more than 2 hours! Moreover the flight has been delayed of more than 1h 30 mins and they advice us just late in the previous evening, causing me to not participate to an important business meeting. No words for this service. I felt very bad, especially for the total lack of respect towards me."
489,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Hyderabad via New Delhi which had a transit time of 14 hours at New Delhi Airport. They asked to recheck in at Delhi Airport. When I was trasferring from International terminal to domestic terminal they dint even allow me to enter the airport stating that my flight has a long time to go and you need to wait. I was asked to wait outside the airport where there was no proper seating facility and waiting area available. When I was trying to contact Air india office they were not ready to listen and they were very rude and arrogant. I’ve been living abroad for the past 6 years and travelled with Malaysian, Singapore, Thai, Cathay Pacific and Sri Lankan airlines and never faced this kind of a problem. I was so unhappy with the customer service they have provided to me and finally when i demanded that I’l lodge a complaint against the airlines they finally allowed me inside the airport. I’ve my return flight on July 9th and I’ve the same 14 hours of transit time. I’m trying to contact the customer service helpline, Delhi airport office, Hyderabad airport office to enquire about the hotel booking or lounge booking but no one is picking up the phone and its keeping on hold line for more than 40 minutes. This is not the way you guys treat a customer. This is the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had in any airlines. Definitely I’m not flying with Air India again and will recommend to all my colleagues and friends not to fly with Air India."
490,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Lucknow to Delhi, a short sector of just 45 minutes it was nice to see the crew served food boxes which composed of a veg sandwich and a mango juice. The best part was the 25kg Free check in luggage. I would fly air India again."
491,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my mother's flight from Ranchi to San Francisco via Delhi in Feb for a May travel date. The night before my mother was scheduled to fly from Ranchi we received a call, mind you, no email stating that she will need to wait at the Delhi airport for 12 hours as her outbound flight from Ranchi to New Delhi has been re scheduled to an hour later. Thankfully, we had made the reservation using a 3rd party, since air india customer service did not pick up our call for over 40 minutes and counting. My mother's entire itinerary was moved a day forward and she still has to wait in Delhi for 12 hours to board her SFO flight. No wheelchair has been assigned and the meals have also not been assigned. To add insult to the injury, I paid extra for aisle seats and there is no way for me to get reimbursed for that expense since the payment applied to flights that have been re scheduled now. I faced similar issue with my in laws itinerary with their itinerary being randomly changed. It can not be by chance, that this lame airline messed with 2 random itineraries both in my family. "
492,"✅ Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to Bangkok via Delhi. Do they know the word customer service? I booked tickets flying from Copenhagen to Bangkok via Delhi. They changed the scheduled times 3 times. The last time they only allowed me 10 minutes in transit flying from Bangkok to Copenhagen via Delhi. I tried to call 3 different numbers to try and fix the problem, but I wasn't able to get a real person to answer the call. I then tried to write to different mail addresses, again I had to wait almost 2 weeks before I finally got an answer. Their solution was to offer me to fly from Bangkok to Delhi 1 day earlier, but then I had 12 hours in transit in one of the worst airports in Asia. When I wrote back to accept their offer, I had to wait another 2 weeks, and finally the night before I was supposed to fly back, they sent me an updated itinerary. On the first leg of my trip, the entertainment didn't work. The seats are very hard and old. The service is very poor, when I compare to other Star Alliance companies. The tickets were cheap, but I will not fly Air India again."
493,✅ Trip Verified |  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience on this 1 hour flight from Lucknow to Jaipur. The check in was smooth and in the flight I was surprised that they serve sandwiches on such a short flight and making rounds asking passengers for more. The free baggage allowance and seat assignment is another reason  represents the full service tag.
494,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Chennai via New Delhi. My initial flight from Chicago to New Delhi got delayed couple of hours because of delayed start. I had only couple hours for my connecting flight at New Delhi. Air India agent at Chicago has rebooked my flight from New Delhi to Chennai without asking my concern and the connecting time now I have is 9hrs. I was told at Chicago that I will be provided with a hotel and asked me to talk to Air India people at New Delhi for allotment. When I reached New Delhi, I was told that they do not have any hotel but can provide me with lounge access which has beds to sleep and fresh up. I was provided with a complimentary dinner from Dilli Street restaurant inside the domestic terminal. But when I came to lounge to take rest I was told that there is communication for them to provide lounge access and we had to escalate this to a manager at New Delhi airport who in turn told me that they did not promise me any lounge access or beds. I was told to just stay at boarding gate.  This is my first time flying with Air India. When I mentioned the same with Air India agents they said that this always happens with Air India and the service is not that great with Air India. When I spoke with manager and asked them ""Shouldn't they be providing accommodation for delays from Air India and is this how you treat passengers?"" Her reply was you can interpret that in any way but I cannot help you in any way except for asking you to wait at departure gate. Entertainment system in international flight did not work for my co passenger. I had to switch seats and we had to take turns to watch movies. I would rate them 0/10, but unfortunately I do not have that option."
495,"✅ Trip Verified | Another very good flight with Air India. I was able to upgrade myself to Business and have not regretted it. The plane was very new and clean (including toilets throughout the flight), flight attendents and food excellent. The flight left on time and arrived in Melbourne about 10 minutes early. Although the layout is 2-2-2, the lie-flat beds are comfortable and Air India provided a warm blanket, pyjamas and a nice amenity set. The only slight drawback was the check-in procedure (that was not flight-specific but for all AI flights) and that took about 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting to get four lines of passengers checked in before me, although these were the 'drop-bag' check in counters. Either Air India has upped its game or I was very lucky to have had two excellent flight experiences."
496,"Not Verified |  Hyderabad to Washington via Delhi. There is so much uncertainty, delays and unscheduled stops. Overall it was horrible. When I booked the ticket it was a 21 hrs flight with 3 hrs halt in Delhi. 4 days before the flight, I got an email of re-routing the plane through Mumbai and it added 7 hrs extra time on the flight. The problems did not stop there. Boarding from Hyderabad was rescheduled to 7:40 PM instead of 7:15 PM which was okay, but after that I received another email saying there is 2 hrs delay and it will be 9:00 PM. I am so frustrated and no one called or sent an apology. This is unreasonable and unethical. There should be accountability, responsibility and explanation. This is not right. They are stressing out travelers and their families."
497,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Paris. I had my worst flying experience so far with this company. I had my retrun flight from Delhi on April 29th 2019. When I arrived at the checking counter and presented my passport, another client with many passports just passed in front of me without any explanation. She was accompanied with what seems to be the manager. The agent ignored me completely and focused only on the new customer with many passports. I asked for explanations many times but the only answer I got is ""one second madam"". After about 10min, when finished with the ""out of nowhere"" customer, he handed me back my passport while telling me that my flight is tomorrow. The only explanation I got is that there was a technical problem with the company's server and there were not enough seats. After getting my boarding card for tomorow's flight I went to Air India's agency to demand an accommodation or any other assistance while waiting for my flight the next day. The only answer I've got is that there is nothing I can get on the spot and all I can do is to send a complaint by email to ask for compensation. If possible, avoid Air India at all cost. They will not even treat you as a human being if you don't know a manager or have some kind of a mysterious privilege"
498,"Not Verified |  I had a flight from Ahmedabad to Najaf via Delhi on April 1 2019. I was travelling with family (2 adults + 2 kids). We all were travelling on the same ticket. I got the boarding passes from Ahmedabad to Delhi in Ahmedabad and was told that the Delhi to Najaf boarding passes will be issued in Delhi. Also, I was told that I will get my luggage in Delhi and will need to check it in again. Fine with that. Reached Delhi, saw that the Najaf flight was scheduled and was showing as scheduled on departure boards as expected. Asked couple of ground staff about the checkin desk etc. I was told to stand in a queue at one of the desk. Stood in the queue for about an hour. Reached the desk and was finally told that the flight has been cancelled. If the flight was cancelled, why was I not informed in Ahmedabad. I was then asked to go to the service desk. The jokers at service desk asked me to go the ticketing desk. So I exited the airport as the ticketing desk was outside the airport. The manager at that desk told me that the only thing which they can do is refund back money of Delhi to Najaf. No compensation. No help in getting a hotel. No help in getting another flight back to Ahmedabad. No nothing. I had no food with me and was not allowed to enter the airport. The manager on the ticketing counter was so rude as if she was working for me. In any case, I have decided not to travel through Air India again in future. And I would suggest other not to travel as well. All the staff members are rude. Ground staff is rude. Air staff is rude. Plus its a government owned airlines. It will stop at any time and you will lose your money and time."
499,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked the combination of 2 flights. 1st flight from Jaipur to Delhi 2nd flight from Delhi to Varanasi. The 1st flight with Air India got a delay of more than 1 hour and because of that we lost our connection to Varanasi and there was no other available flight to Varanasi on that day. While we where waiting for the Air India flight in Jaipur we asked several people from your company if we still could catch our 2nd flight and all people we asked told us that it would be possible. So we trust we could make it and unfortunately that was not what happens which ruined our vacation plans to Varanasi, people and make us lost money that we were not considering."
500,"Not Verified |  Shanghai to New Delhi. Positives: Main course was okay Arrived on time Negatives: Otherwise, the food was rubbish The hollywood section of the entertainment was frozen so didn't work, not like it offered good or new movies anyway. Only one small meal was served on a 7.5 hour flight. Seat was hard and uncomfortable. Interiors were outdated and in tatters even though it was a relatively new plane. Service was unremarkable. They didn't allow my bag to go even 0.5kg over the limit, wanted me to pay 200RMB extra. The cabin was very smelly, nothing felt clean at all. Even Chinese carriers are better than Air India."
501,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on 13/4/19 from Amritsar to Mumbai. Thank god Air India is going, very much better, joyful crew, food was amazing, and above all pilot who landed 25 minutes early. Keep it up."
502,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had bought a round ticket Mumbai to Hong Kong and Bangkok to Mumbai. While my trip from Mumbai to Hong Kong was a surprisingly good experience with excellent food and service, the return trip was not half as nice. The cabin staff were rude to say the least. And not only to me but to several passengers. When one passenger spoke out, more than 30 passengers clapped to support him. "
503,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible communications and poor service, not again! Was flying from Kathmandu to Kolkata on the 22nd of April. The flight kept getting delayed and there was no announcement or any sort of information. The Gate no was not provided as well. We kept guessing what was happening. Finally got to know that the Gate no. has been provided from staff but the same was not announced or updated on the digital boards. When the boarding started, there were two weird vehicles attached to the stairs of the plane, which were basically for another round of security checks. It was so hard to get up in those vehicles as the stairs were steep and my mom and dad who are old, struggled badly. Male security persons were opening ladies purses and searching them so disrespectfully. When I asked what's this checking for, I was not given any answers. The body check was also done in the most disrespectful way and everyone was feeling frustrated. When we finally came onboard, none of the staff or the captain apologised for the almost 2 hrs delay. Everyone seemed as if the flight is on time. Finally landed in Kolkata and many passengers missed their connecting flights because of such irresponsible behaviour of Air India. Never again! Such a shame!"
504,"✅ Trip Verified |  Air India Mumbai to Bengaluru. The check in counters were full of passengers as there were only 2 check in personnel who were there so the airline could have done better in staffing more check in agents at the desks which would have sped up the process. Even though the flight departed 30 mins after the scheduled time, we made up for the time on air and reach the destination 15 mins after arrival which was appreciated. Surprisingly the airline had opted for the A319 on this route even though the flight was full. Dinner was served on this flight which consisted of mixed vegetables with a paratha and biryani which was quite tasty. The crew were also enforcing the rules such as ensuring that no pax were roaming around when the seatbelt sign was on which was quite positive and showed that they were serious about their jobs. This was one of the better BOM-BLR flights I had taken."
505,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Delhi. An excellent flight, left on time, arrived Delhi 50 minutes early. The flight was about 80% full and other than a few very minor things I could not fault Air India. The food provided was excellent (breakfast of egg omelette with sausages, croissant, butter, jam, coffee/tee), lunch consisted of three choices (lamb, chicken, vegetarian). The chicken came with rice and vegetables with a separate side salad and desert, all of which was tasty and of good quality. On top of this there were two drink-runs and before landing they provided another sandwich. The seat was good (admittedly I forked out for an exit row which I then was happily able to have the whole row to myself), legroom good enough for a giraffe. The only very minor minus points were the not-working global map and a rather limited selection of new films. The crew was responsive and courteous and happy to assist. Overall, one of the more enjoyable flights in economy I have had over the last 40 or so years of flying."
506,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India Bengaluru to Mumbai. Upon arrival at the airport, we were notified that the servers for the airline were down since 3am and so due to this, there were flight delays and a huge cluster around the check in desks as the agents were trying their best to resolve the issues and get things moving as smoothly as possible. The airport manager was particularly impressive in ensuring that all the passengers were checked in for their respective flights and due to the systems being down, the agents had to manually write the flight details on the boarding passes to compensate for this unforseen situation. As a result of this, the flight which was supposed to depart at 6.45am instead left at 7.35am when pushback commenced. The aircraft cabin was very fresh and clean as the airline have leased the Airbus A320 neos so they are comparatively newer. The crew were lively, engaging and kept providing regular updates and even though the load on this flight was quite full, they still were attentive and polished. On this sector, a breakfast consisting of idlis, upma and croissants was served which was very tasty. Touchdown was 47 mins past the arrival time which was not exactly ideal but this has been mentioned extensively many times that the airline needs to improve in the OTP area. The in-flight was by and large, excellent. And if they can show their reliability with regards to OTP, they can beat any other airline on their day."
507,✅ Trip Verified |  Dehradun to Delhi via Pune. Pathetic service. Air India lives up to their expectations yet again - late again. Poor service by staff who have unbelievably poor social skills. If given an option never opt for Air India.
508,✅ Trip Verified |  Sagwon to Hyderabad. We had a very bad experience with airlines and the staff. The flight was supposed to depart by 5 pm. We were waiting in the queue for boarding and there is no response from air india staff. After enquiring many times at 4:40 they informed that the flight got canceled. How could airlines cancel the flight at the last moment. This is a second bad experience. Even taxi drivers at Shirdi airport are saying the flight is canceling very frequently and Pls don't relay on air india. If this is the case why are troubling us. Stop running the service. I want to go rating below zero. Unfortunately there is no option for that.
509,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pune to Sydney via Delhi. My 60 year old mother with limited English speaking completed Delhi to Sydney on 15/03/2019. The flight departure time was 13.15 pm however it departed on 22.30 pm as the flight got delayed way too much and caused a great inconvenience & stress. Till the day we never know the real reason for the delay. The only great thing they did at least supplied food in the afternoon. We contacted Air India regarding compensation for delay however, the request was denied.  It is one of the most expensive airlines with such a poor service."
510,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to New York via Delhi. When I saw there is a delay in my first flight from Hyderabad to Delhi, I reached out to Customer service and they said we need to talk to someone at the airport counter to get alternate arrangements. we went to Airport counter and explained the situation. They said the next flight (AI101) would wait until all the passengers are boarded. By the time we arrive in New Delhi AI101 flight already left and now they are saying next flight would be next day same timings and until then they are going to provide accommodation and food. I dont understand how come these guys are so reckless in handling the customers. Everyone has their own schedule and some wont be able to break it."
511,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to San Francisco. I was appalled by the lack of cabin services. None of the TVs worked in rows 30-32 across all seats in spite of repeated resets by the crew. Imagine that on a 16+ hour flight. The remotes did not work and neither did the reading lights. So, I was unable to read as well. I did not see the slightest smile on any of the crew members. I know we have come to expect poor service on airlines but this kind of customer service is unacceptable. Is this how Air India is representing the national airlines of India? Shame on them."
512,"✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Mumbai via Delhi with Air India. The inflight services were pathetic. The crew were negligent, directed to the wrong seat and then made it look like it's your fault when the passenger claimed her seat. Embarrassing! Requests for a blanket was forgotten/ignored. Outdated inflight entertainment films. Flight was delayed over 2hrs and Baggage did not arrive at destination. Luggage arrived after 8 days, after numerous calls and emails. Ruined my holiday. No decency to provide updates. Pathetic customer service. What more could go wrong? All this is worth INR 3000 compensation! Worst airlines ever! Worst flight experience ever! First and last time."
513,✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Delhi. Excellent service by the airline. I am very happy and would recommend it. They provided food and blankets in domestic flight as well. Keep up this service.
514,"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Delhi. Poor Customer Service. Difficult to get in touch with US Staff. Inidia Phone Staff is not supportive and not clear. I made a mistake in booking. Usually, you should be able to cancel or make changes within 24 hours. The staff was charging money for cancellation within that timeframe as well."
515,Not Verified |  Birmingham to New Delhi. We have not yet flown but in the past 3 months have found Air India the worst airline I have ever booked with and I am well travelled. I booked the flight in my maiden name but my passport is in my married name. I tried to seek an amendment but was told it was not possible. I had to cancel it and rebook the flight for double the fare. Air India have took it upon themselves to cancel the flight! It is an absolute joke. 
516,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bengaluru. I had rushed in order to check in for this flight and to drop my baggage because I was running late and I noted that the flight which was supposed to depart at 8.15pm was instead rescheduled to depart at 9pm due to the late arrival of the incoming flight which ensured in an ironic way that I was able to check in successfully for this flight although for other pax, it must have surely been an annoyance. I have travelled very frequently on the BOM-BLR route and vice versa and I have always observed that this route is almost always delayed which is not ideal and perhaps the airline should do something in order to reduce the delays. The boarding started 1 hour 15 minutes after the original departure time. The load was quite full for this flight as there were many office goers who were returning back from work. Dinner was served on this flight which consisted of a vegetarian fare of mixed vegetables and dal rice followed by gajar halwa and dahi vada for dessert. The food on Air India's flights has always been sumptuous and this is one of their main USP's. Landing was of-course delayed but the disembarkation and baggage retrieval was done very swiftly. The flight in itself was very comfortable and even though it was delayed, it ensured that I was able to make the flight on time although flight delays is something that is still affecting Air India and unless and until they can find a way to resolve these issues, the airline will be at a disadvantage as compared to other rival carriers. Hopefully they will take note and try to rectify these issues surrounding flight delays because from my observation, most domestic pax prefer not to waste time on delays and get from their origin to destination with minimal fuss."
517,"✅ Trip Verified |  The return flight from San Francisco to Delhi was scheduled for a late night departure and being quite empty ensured that there would be sufficient seats to stretch out to sleep. The flight departed on time for this epic 18 hour flight which was flying eastwards. The crew were very helpful and assisted a lot. There were 3 meal services offered on this flight (refreshments / lunch / dinner) including alcoholic / non alcoholic beverages so this ensured that satisfaction was there. Throughout the flight, I was able to rest comfortably and was even able to watch a movie or two which was very good. As the Pakistani airspace still remained close, the flight has to go through Mumbai / Gujarat before arriving at Delhi and yet the flight still landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Reached the destination fresh which was very important during this long haul flight. Thank you Air India for such a wonderful flight. Air India may not be a luxurious airline but it is much much better than what people think. For anyone travelling to the west coast, I would highly recommend this product as it provides great value for money and reduces the travel time considerably."
518,"Not Verified |  We had a flight Madrid to Delhi for this Easter and two weeks of the trip we have canceled alleging that the airspace of Pakistan is closed, yes, only have canceled the two less profitable routes to the company, from Madrid and Birmingham , nevertheless, from other places they have not canceled the flight, diverting the trajectory to avoid the conflict zone (Pakistan). Incredible the lack of seriousness of the Indian company. ES: Teníamos un vuelo Madrid - Delhi para esta semana santa y a dos semanas del viaje nos han cancelado alegando que el espacio aéreo de Pakistán se encuentra cerrado, eso sí, sólo han cancelado las dos rutas que menos rentables salen a la compañía, desde Madrid y Birmingham, sin embargo, desde otros lugares no han cancelado el vuelo desviando la trayectoria para evitar la zona conflictiva (Pakistán). Increíble la falta de seriedad de la compañía india."
519,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai via Indore. After landing in DEL, as the airline had provided a very tight connecting flight from Delhi to Mumbai as a result of which that connection was missed. So the airline staff, had provided an alternate connecting flight but this was via Indore which added up to the travel time which was not exactly ideal. What was surprising was that the airline did not have any connecting flights to Mumbai from Delhi between 9am till 3pm. Because Delhi to Mumbai is usually such a trunk route that there are enough flights. So this was not very good. During the checkin of the flight, the check-in agent was very helpful and told us about the status of the flight including the seat availability and other details which was really helpful. The flight in itself was slightly delayed due to connecting passengers from Srinagar. From Delhi to Indore a light snack featuring a sandwich and a drink were provided which was good. After landing in Indore, we had to sit inside the aircraft as the servicing was done and other passengers joined in. For the remaining Indore-Mumbai leg, again a snackbox was provided and arrival was 30 mins delayed which was not preferable. It seems that Air India's international product is fabulous but on the domestic sector there can be improvements with regards to the frequency of flights / flight delays. The flights were pretty decent. Would recommend but would expect more connections and frequencies of flights because I had to wait almost 5 hours to get my connecting flight back to Mumbai and that also with a stopover."
520,"✅ Trip Verified |  No matter how bad you think the Air India might be, it's actually going to be worse than that. I'm a multi-million miler, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a worse experience than 15 hours on Air India. Not all of it is the airline's fault--but if you connect from a domestic flight to leave from Delhi, you go through seven different ID and security checks before getting on the plane: everything from accessing the terminal to accessing the gate, each has its own separate security inspection. I'm not sure what terrible people they believe would pose a threat to an airline which needs no help falling apart. At the gate. We were delayed several hours for reasons unknown and unexplained. When we did board, there was immense disappointment. The seat cushion at my seat was clearly from a regional aircraft and did not fit the seat, It covered maybe 75% of the seat area, and the rest of me was sitting on the gap or directly on the metal seat frame. The entertainment system was non-functional. A 15 hour flight, and it was broken. But whatever, it's 4AM and we've been waiting almost four hours to leave. It's time to push back. And we're back to the gate. At least the pilot checked to see if we had fuel before taking off. Because apparently we didn't have enough. And refueling took another 40 minutes. That hardly seems like a top up because we idled the engines for too long. And now we're finally on our way. The food served was...pretty dreadful. The cabin crew did their best, but the condition of the aircraft wasn't their fault. However, the cleanliness of the aircraft was indeed their responsibility. By midflight, all but one lavatory had run out of toilet paper and paper towels. The one lavatory which hadn't run out of paper had an actual hole punched in the bottom of the toilet, and was covered in human waste as it could no longer flush. It was probably the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen, and even worse, there were no alternatives--waiting another 6 hours wouldn't end well for me. The ironic thing is that the inflight maps show the locations of famous shipwrecks as you fly over them--which serves as a reminder that there are some journeys that actually are worse than flying Air India. Change here needs to start from the top, and run through this organization like an avalanche. They'll need years of good reviews and quality results before I'd consider them again, but I don't think they'll have that luxury."
521,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to Delhi. I was skeptical when booking a flight with Air India because the website is like from 90'.  When boarding I was pleasantly surprised. Even for me (2m tall guy) more than enough leg room, comfortable seats. The dinner was included for this short (2h30m) flight."
522,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Kathmandu. Don't ever fly this this airlines, it was overbooked and they will just bump you out of the flight. The duty managers, and ground staff are very impolite, lack hospitality and are unaware about customer rights."
523,"✅ Trip Verified | The second onward connection from Delhi to San Francisco was scheduled in the evening and on this sector surprisingly not all the seats were full as the airline has increased the frequency of flights to SFO. Boarding happened on time and departure was ahead of the scheduled time which was a big plus. Once airborne on this 17 hour flight, the crew regularly looked after the passengers with food and drinks at regular intervals. At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. I believe along with DEL-JFK, this flight is also one of Air India's best products as it reduces the travel time considerably and the service is warm and hospitable. Kudos to the crew for an amazing flight."
524,"✅ Trip Verified | I had taken the morning flight to Delhi as part of my onward connection to San Francisco and as the web check-in was already done prior to arriving at the airport, the baggage just had to be dropped at the counter. Then post security checks boarding happened on time which was a plus but as the checked in baggage was still getting loaded it caused a slight delay in pushback and departure happened 20 mins past the scheduled time. Once airborne, refreshments were served consisting of pav Bhaji with samosa chaat and chocolate cake which was very sumptuous. Arrival into Delhi was 15 mins past the departure time but it didn't cause any problems with catching the onward flight. It was a good standard flight and everything went well. Thank you Air India."
525,"Not Verified |  Flight was delayed from Goa to Bangalore by 8 hours by Air India, then they brought our connecting flight from Bangalore to Bangkok forward by one hour too. Therefore missed the Bangkok flight. The staff at Bangalore were the most unhelpful, lazy staff I have ever encountered. Eventually, wanted to reroute us to Delhi, wait for hours there, and then fly to Bangkok arriving more than a day late. Ended up buying a new ticket from Bangalore to Bangkok with another airline. Low and behold our returning flight with Air India we were informed when we arrived at he airport at 4am, was delayed by 8.5 hours. Missed our connecting flight again, going back to Goa and had to buy new tickets. Air India totally didn't care. Useless, airline - don't deserve any business. Will never use again. Avoid at all costs."
526,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Delhi. What a way to celebrate the international womens day than spend 5 hours with mom at the Delhi customs office, where we literally left close to midnight. This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. This was my first and last experience with Air India My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together. There were a lot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response from Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago . Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection. After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building. The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another. Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. "" The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. The customs kept repeating that the Air India was not responding . However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a a scene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding , the server was working and the money was collected in cash. We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through. Finally, Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work. I do hope no one else goes through, what I went through I would not recommend anyone to use this airline after my experience. The airline is 2.5 on a scale of 10, there are some serious concerns with the management."
527,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to Mumbai. The ticket is not showing up info that flight terminal is changed. When I called the airline authorities a day before my travel to confirm on two wheelchair requirements, they acknowledged for it but never stated that terminal is different. When I called at day of travel they stated we have not received wheelchair ask from you, we don't have escalation point of contact so call later. My dad had to carry my old aged grandmoms through shuttle bus and had to arrange wheelchair at the airport after making several requests"
528,"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Amritsar. As my wife have pain knees, we thought pay for seats with extra leg room, paid £120 for both of us for both ways. When we arrived at check in desk Birmingham Airport, lady said are you both physically fit, I replied no, then she said you can’t have these exit seats, I have to assign you different seats. Plus she said we can get refund and gave me email address and phone number to contact Air India. I emailed them after 5 weeks they told me they can’t give me refund it’s on their website in term and conditions, I am sure I didn’t see that somewhere when I choose the seats."
529,✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Delhi. Air India is a wonderful airline. The service is great. The only problems are that the seats cushion are uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment screen is a pain to use. Otherwise everything else is good and the flight was on time.
530,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Bangalore. The aircraft was very old with torn seat covers and very poor seat cushions and cabin lighting. The food was decent, service was decent, but the drinks options were limited to only two. The toilets seats were very untidy with a lot unclean spots all around. The punctuality and timing were smooth."
531,✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Delhi. The service is great. The problems are that the seats cushion is dead and the inflight entertainment screen is a pain to use. Otherwise everything else is good and the flight was on time.
532,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Toronto by Air Canada and connecting flight from Heathrow to Delhi by Air India. It was my first time flying Air India. I had a terrible experience. The flight attendants were so rude and unattended. When asked for coffee etc, the FA would throw the cup in front of you, twice it caused to spill the coffee on me. She lacked people skills big time. She looked miserable, no smile. She wouldn't even acknowledge you if you asked for assistant. It was obvious she didn't like the job she was doing. We were all strongly discouraged to travel Ail India in the future."
533,"✅ Trip Verified |  Traveling from Paris to Thailand via Delhi, before getting onboard at Paris my wife was forced to write a form saying that she was not going to be more the one month in Thailand because of the fact that she only had a one way ticket and never the ground agent asked my wife anything about visa need it to travel to Thailand because of the fact the she is a Venezuela citizen and we were told that visa was no required because she was a US resident,. The three boarding passes were granted to her and then she boarded an Air India flight from Paris to Delhi, everything when fine until she landed at Delhi and was ready to take her flight from there to Bangkok where the ground personnel realized that my wife did not have a Thailand visa and after having the boarding passes in Paris by the Air India personnel access to board that flight was denied. The Thai Airways ground agent when the extra mile and try to help my wife in any possible matter but her hands where tied and nothing more couldn’t been done, therefore the Thai personnel refer my wife back to the Air India agents and that’s where our nightmare started. First of all the agent was very rude, my wife English is very limited and when I ask her to pass the phone to allow me to talk to him and see what our options were, after having a very un respectful conversation with the agent he toss the phone back to my wife and refuses to talk to me, another agent with a very kind attitude helped my wife, unfortunately the decision was made and my only option was to buy another business class ticket to my wife back to Paris. My wife was a victim of disrespectful treatment by Air India Ground agents I can not believe after you dropping the ball and not following standard operating procedures in Paris in order to review documents to full paying business class passengers we have to be liable of paying another business class ticket and even worst to pay for hotel accommodations. The following morning she was escorted from her room to the plane, forced to board last after everyone else were onboard, after arriving in Paris she had to wait until all passenger deplane in order to wait for the flight attendant who was holding her passport illegally retained."
534,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to New York via Mumbai. I have been trying to reschedule my ticket with Air India  for the last four hours . Every time they are about to change my ticket the call gets disconnected. This was about 11 p.m clock Indian standard time I called them 5 times to reschedule my ticket. Fifth time I finally had to request then to call me back if the calm gets disconnected this was about 1:30 a.m and again the call gets disconnected and they call me back at 1:45 to reschedule my ticket. Now they are asking me for another 300 USD for no show as it is less then 24 hours for me to fly out of India. They have no morals, no courtesy, all they want is money off you. Very disappointed"
535,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Vadodara via Delhi . I travelled with my dad, my dad is 87 years old. In Delhi International airport. I waiting for wheel chair at least 45 minutes, then gave up and walked to Domestic airport, May be half mile. The airline ticket provided wheel chair, but they did not supply this. Not good service in Delhi International airport."
536,"✅ Trip Verified |  Leh to Delhi. Flight was cancelled, because of supposed bad weather conditions. This did not stop other airlines from flying. Next day they just announced there is no aircraft to get passengers waiting overnight. I don't know what they were thinking. They didn't even let us in to the building with -15 degrees outside. Outrageous. After screaming and shouting they've let us on free seats at another flight. What happened to the rest passengers I don't know. Avoid this airlines at all cost. It's a joke. Staff manager at the airport was so arrogant, he made my girlfriend cry. Now they just ignore our emails with complaints."
537,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Hong Kong. I had the pleasure of flying Air India after a long time. What a pleasant experience it was. Comfortable seats, enough leg room, fantastic food, crew was superb. The flight was superb n landed 20 min before schedule. Thank you Air India."
538,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Rajkot via Mumbai. My grandmother was travelling through the Air India flight - AI144. She was unwell on the day, plus she is short in stature. So, she was having trouble putting the luggage on the overhead compartment. A female air hostess passed by and my grandmother asked her for help. These are the exact words of that air hostess: ""There are three hundred people in this flight and we cannot go about putting everyone's luggage. That is not our duty. You should have thought twice before bringing this bag."" And she left. A kind passenger nearby helped my grandmother, aged 70, to put the bag up. "
539,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Bengaluru in economy class was a comfortable and safe flight and even though the boarding and departure was delayed by 15-20 minutes due to air traffic. The pilots tried to make up for the lost time enroute on this 2 hours 10 minutes flight which was good but unfortunately we landed 40 minutes behind schedule.  For dinner, there was a good hot meal consisting of a paratha, dal makhni and panner masala with rice and a sweet dessert. The food quality was excellent and filling. The staff was cheerful with a good attitude. Overall, I would recommend the airline if one is looking for basic, solid service without too much glamour. The airline can certainly improve on it's OTP because that's where they are losing the perception edge as passengers believe other carriers are more reliable. I would continue to fly with them."
540,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India from Bengaluru to Kolkata. This flight was the perfect example of when Air India gets everything right on this early morning flight to Kolata. From the self check in kiosks which printed the boarding passes to the flight itself which in fact departed on time and arrived 25 minutes well ahead of the scheduled arrival time. The flight was a very smooth flight with breakfast served consisting of an idli and upma along with fresh fruits and coffee which was very filling. Crew and staff were very quick and prompt in their service. Air India usually has problems when it comes to matters of reliability and OTP but on this occassion, they exceeded expectations and infact arrived well before time. The aircraft was among the newer 320s with sharklets and the seat was fresh and comfortable. Would like to thank the crew and staff for this flight."
541,"✅ Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to Delhi. Spacy and comfortable seats in the business class, but absolutely horrible catering - worse than any low budget Airlines economy class. Flying out of Copenhagen, they should have been able to offer something better, but obviously they chose to bring some terrible food from somewhere else. Also the entertainment system and especially the offer of international movies as pretty poor. Next time I will chose another airline."
542,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Bangkok. I was on flight Air India 332 to Bangkok on January 27th and I was treated so poorly. The flight attendant was extremely rude to me and would not serve me. I have never been treated so badly on a flight before- it actually made me sick to my stomach. I asked for a glass of wine and he denied me. He told me to “not treat him that way”. I pay money for this service, and to be treated as if I am a second class citizen. I will never ride Air India ever again. There is a group of men next to me who are being extremely loud and the fight attendants are no doing nothing about it. They are making kissing sounds at me, yet when I tell the flight attendants they tell me to just ignore it. I expect to be treated with respect when I’m on a flight, and am truly disgusted that you hire flight attendants like this who treat people like second class citizen. I am so disappointed in this service."
543,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangalore to Bangkok. Bad service (except for one flight purser who did his best). The service took ages to start, with passengers starving. The only time the air hostess had a smile on her face was she said that the bar was closed - after serving a single can of beer on an international flight!"
544,"✅ Trip Verified |  
San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi. This is the worst international airline I have taken ever.  The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service. Most of the IFE screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. "
545,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my wife flew with Air India on the 1st February from Goa to Mumbai, Mumbai to Delhi and Delhi to Copenhagen. We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water. Additionally, our bags went missing so we had no clothes to change or any hygiene appliances with us.We had a very bad ending of our holidays because of Air India's staff incompetence. I cannot understand how this company can be member of Star Alliance. Air India blacklisted forever."
546,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew Business class from Delhi to Paris CDG on AI 143 on 01 Jan 2019. The entertainment system for the entire plane was out of order, and the crew knowingly departed with the information that the system was unable to load any content including the basic flight map. In addition, the seat functions did not work in Business class due to repeated hard restarts of the cabin by the crew. So, this business class day flight turned out to be a nightmare, and not what is expected from a Star Alliance member. The crew was very apologetic, and they told me the system was also faulty on the two previous flights to and from FRA on previous day. Your customer contact center sent the following feedback: “Sometimes such efforts may not be successful and can be rectified only on the return of the aircraft to the base station. We are extremely sorry, as this complimentary amenity could not be enjoyed by you. Please be apprised that the shortcomings have been brought to the attention of the Department concerned and the Airline has already initiated the process of rectifying these issues, which soon will be taken care of. Any shortfall in customer servces is once again”’ The entertainment system and a functioning seat is not complimentary. I pay for this service as part of the ticket. It is a basic service which you failed to provide. Especially in Business Class. No compensation provided at all by Air India. Flight was on time, food was rather poor (maybe on par with premium economy on other airlines), crew friendly but rather hopeless. Lounge in Delhi is horrible. Food is almost non existent and staff is rather arrogant. I feel sorry for the staff as they seem to be in denial that Air India is now only a small player in the Indian aviation market."
547,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India has by far the dirtiest planes I've ever been on. The staff are rude and incompetant and the planes are old. Nothing was cleaned and the entertainment systems didn't work for the majority of the passengers. The food smelt so bad that it wasn't possible to eat. They overbook all flights so you are packed in like sardines. Upgrading is a waste as the planes are so old and dirty that you aren't getting anything by upgrading. You could not pay me to fly them, it was that bad! They also weigh your carry on luggage. There is no wifi and as weith the entertainment, the charging ports don't work on the flights either. "
548,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. Not recommended. From Male to Bangalore is 2 hours flight. We left hotel at 8:30 am for 10:55 flight. We were told flight is delayed by 1 hour at check in counter. After 1 hour we were told 3 hours delay. Then after that 1 more hour delay. At 3 PM. We were told our flight is cancelled and aircraft never even left Delhi. After hustle we we provided with very nice SriLanka Air flight leaving Male at 8:45 PM! But that time we already spent 12 hours in airport. With one stop we reached Bangalore at 3:30 AM! That made 18 hours trip from Male to Bangalore, instead of 2. Others passengers told us flights are cancelled regularly. They are very often late. My husband missed his connection flight to Toronto via Frankfurt and was made to pay for that flight. Unbelievable! Never fly Air India."
549,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Bangalore via Delhi. They're not able to answer simple questions, are blatantly rude and speak poor English. We fly to India a couple times a year and my husband and I decided to give Air India a try. We will never fly this airline again. My husband got sick during our trip and was hospitalized. We needed to change our return flight due to this ordeal, and Air India was a horror to deal with in the midst of this terrible experience. Most international airlines waive Date Change fees when health emergencies are concerned - but Air India charges the max of $300, and ripped us off for the fare difference as well, although we were changing our flight from a peak week to a much less busy travel week. Half their customer service agents over the phone were incompetent and very rude. As for the flights themselves, the aircraft are old, entertainment system keeps breaking down, and the flight attendants were ok, but they do not respond to the call buttons."
550,"✅ Trip Verified |  Male to Trivandrum. Terrible experience with entire booking process and customer service from the airline. We were given wrong information by your staff and we were denied boarding for our flight because apparently there was no transfer desk at our transit airport! It cost us our return ticket, unnecessary stress at the airport, and an extra USD $2000 for alternative and last minute flights to make it back home on time for urgent business. Upon returning home, we made several attempts to reach authorized management to address our case - the responses were slow (if any) and unprofessional with no attention to our case. We received standard replies and it has been almost a month now since we have received any updates about our complaint. "
551,"Not Verified |  Bangkok to Birmingham via Delhi. Airline staff surly and unfriendly. Not helpful. Most staff didn't even say 'hello' or 'goodbye' when entering/exiting the plane. Food - Average. Hot meal was ok but the snack was a horrible cheese sandwich! In-flight entertainment - movie selection was not great. Equipment was old and on my return flight the headphone socket didn't work so I had no sound for 9 hours! Transfer - only had 1 hour on the outward journey which meant a frantic rush to transfer - Delhi airport is rather old and the staff are slow. Leg room - pretty good. Cleanliness - bad. On the return flight we flew from Birmingham (UK) to Delhi via Amritsar. We had to wait on the plane for an hour as they got the plane ready for new passengers. The standard of cleaning was terrible. You could tell that the head rest covers were old and dirty and the carpet on the floor looked filthy too. If you have other airlines to choose from, use them instead."
552,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to Washington via Delhi. First and last experience. Without going into details, this was by far the worst customer service in an airlines Ive experienced. The air hostesses sit around in the back chit chatting and on their phones and don't provide service beyond the basic meals. Call buttons are mostly ignored, bathrooms are never cleaned/maintained, several tv screens/remotes were not working, no seat belts for infants, and they could care less. Pathetic is too kind of a word for the service we experienced on our plane. Will never fly Air India again."
553,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to San Francisco. This was my first time in AI business class, I was traveling at very short notice due to a family medical emergency and AI had the cheapest fare $3400 RT. My collection of experiences reaffirms why this airline which had its heyday in the 70s and 80s is now the laughing stock of the airline industry. The staff's attitude is unmotivated and their approach lacks professionalism - they kept trying to take away my food and drink when i clearly hadn't finished, and otherwise wouldn't clear items when i had finished for a while. The chief purser only stayed in the 1st class section and never came out once to introduce himself or spend any time in the biz class section. The tray table hinge was broken (both ways of the roundtrip) which meant it was pressing against my thigh and couldn't be moved front/back. And the seat controls are atrociously bad - its hard to figure out which way its actually moving and the grating jerky movements make for a poor customer experience. The meals served was mostly lukewarm or cold and the staff didn't seem to care. If this is the experience in business class, i really dread to think what the economy class must be like. Clearly the airline strategy is to compete on price, not quality of service. And the final straw is that i got an email today asking for feedback - when i provided it and try to submit i got a response (please note the spellings) ""Server Error Please Try Later Sorry for Inconvinence casued to you. Team Air-India"". This is an unbelievably poor airline that is being badly managed and run for years. It will be a miracle if they ever find a buyer, probably best to cut off the oxygen, liquidate it and not burden Indian taxpayers any more"
554,"✅ Trip Verified |  Stockholm to Bangkok via Delhi. The interior looked rather deteriorated and service was shoddy. The tv was held together with masking tape, and you gotta hold it up yourself! The remote control had no buttons, basically useless, the touch screen was barely working and the remote was dirty. The chair was rough and it snagged my stocking. For each leg of my trip I had to call crew assistance once, and none came until the food was served. Only spicy food was available. Barely any crew service on the 7-hour flight, but on the 3-hour flight they offered refreshments occasionally. I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words. This is the first time I've flown with them and I can't recommend. I've traveled on LCC many times and not one experience was as unfortunate as this. For the price - there are surely better options."
555,✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to New York. Worst airline ever. We had to make an emergency landing at another airport and through incompetence and negligence waited 4 hours at another airport without food or water. Their mistakes made everyone miss their connecting flights which they refused to hold even though it affected hundreds of passengers. We waited over three hours at New Delhi airport just to get new boarding passes for flights 24 hours later.  All because they refused to pay another airline. No food or water for another 4 hours before forcing us to share airport hotel rooms with complete strangers. They refused to tell us what was going on which created chaos and much longer waits for everything. I now have to spend at least another additional 30 hours of traveling just to get home. Do not fly this airline!! It is not safe and you are treated like garbage with no customer service whatsoever. 
556,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Hyderabad via Delhi. Government run airline that does not care about quality. Poor seats that are sunk down. Entertainment system touch screen is least responsive. Audio quality is poor. Head phones provided are inadequate to enjoy the video. Toilet papers in bathroom are not sufficiently stocked. On the positive side, staff tries to help"
557,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Dammam. We were charged for an upgrade and then pushed to fly in Economy class. After long followup local Office in Saudi Paid the fair Difference after almost one year. Last August was flying with Family from same airport to Dammam and the Air India Staff delayed to me on counter for unnecessary reasons for almost 90 minutes. there was extra security due to 15th august and I Was then offloaded form the flight because of delay. I came on the counter before 3 and half hour from the flight time. The staff took 10 hours to evacuate me from the immigration and bring my baggage and then misbehaved. I was forced to pay around 73000 INR to book next day flight. Next day the flight was full economy and and i was forced to travel in Economy even after I was charged with a business class fair. When i wrote an email to concerned department they answered me an annoying reply and blaming to stuck on the immigration and missed the flight by myself, which was a lie which i could not digest since it did not took more than 10 minutes on immigration for all my family to get through.  I wish I will never travel on this airline ever in future."
558,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bengaluru. On this early morning flight, checkin didn't take more than 5 mins to complete and boarding started on time, the load on this sector was around 75-80% full. Tthe departure was delayed by 25-30 mins and also the aircraft had to taxi towards the far east side of the runway instead of the usual runway 27 so as a result the departure got delayed even further. However once airborne, the crew and staff were pleasant and  providing regular flight updates and a nice breakfast consisting of some idlis and veg cutlets. Collection of the baggage also wasn't a hassle. Air India doesn't provide luxurious services, but provides a good solid product and passengers expect reliability: in other words, a good OTP which the airline has tried improving in recent times but there is still a lot more improvement to be made in this area especially when one considers that their competitors are perceived to be more efficient in this area."
559,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Delhi. Air India has managed to take its standards successfully below sub-par. Bad seats, bad food, bad service, bad entertainment - our audio sets were broken, video was blank - worst ever I've seen on an international flight. To top it all, the flight was delayed due to a mechanical failure and we were stranded at Delhi airport for 6 hours in the middle of the night. They didn't have accommodation so my kids and I slept on the floor! Not to mention, the crew was the least bit apologetic about the delay and were literally pushing people to make way. As if this wasn't enough, the price was a ridiculous $1900 per ticket! This airline is a disgrace to India."
560,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Mumbai. As part of the Christmas and New Year vacations, I had decided to fly with Air India on this morning flight but unfortunately the flight was overbooked due to which an additional charge had to be paid in order to upgrade to Business. Even though there were rumours to the effect that the staff were trying to get the pax fill in the business class even though seats were available in Economy in order to gain as much revenue during the holiday season. Fast forward into boarding and even though the departure time was 8.50am, we only started boarding after 9am. Then there was a further delay of around 1 hour in the aircraft pushback so the flight actually departed at around 10.40am which was not expected and disappointing. The Business Class seats in themselves were pretty good and the in-flight service was  exceptional with a welcome watermelon juice drink, crew being engaging, friendly and personable. For Breakfast, I had opted for the cheese omelet which tasted very good along with coffee and croissants.  The pilots tried to cover the lost time enroute which was admirable and soon after landing, disembarkation was smooth and the luggage was received swiftly and promptly. Air India is a pretty solid airline and compared to other carriers such as Jet or Indigo, it is pretty solid and stable, if there has been one thing that has been holding the airline back, it's the on time performance which has been lagging considerably behind it's competitors. "
561,✅ Trip Verified |  I wanted to seek help from customer service and trying their phone (call centre number available on google) after every half an hour but their number was not available. i waited in queue for approx 30min but no response. I sincerely suggest them to update their customer service number correctly or if number is already updated then at least try to cater everyone so that customers like me will not face challenges. Your answering machine says that I'm in queue and waiting time is 10min. Believe me i kept dialing customer care and waiting for more then 30min but no response. I tried using other ways to communicate with them but that will be of no use considering they claim to get back only in 24 hours.
562,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Hyderabad via Delhi. This is the worst airline I ever flew with. I took flight from Madrid where they outsourced to wfs not even a single Air India person was present to help, there was huge language problem and no proper discipline maintained by staff. Flight got delayed by 6 hours and on top of that systems error out causing people standing in lines for hours together and on top of it connections forget about that. Systems are no way getting up and the talk is that international flight might get cancelled."
563,✅ Trip Verified | London to Mumbai. Received horrible customer service from Air India. Booked my flight to India on Air India website and our code shared flight from Canada to London was cancelled. Air India kept routing us to different number and they haven't been very helpful. Called Air Canada and they said the flight has been cancelled in July and yet I was able to book this flight on the Air India website. Air Canada is not able to help us because we didn't book the ticket on their website and Air India is not taking any ownership of his situation. We are kind of stuck in the airport and I am travelling with a 6 month old baby. They are not booking us into another flight or they not giving us out refund. Strongly recommend not to book from Air India. Horrible airline.
564,✅ Trip Verified |  Lazy in-flight crew and doesn't want to do their duties. Mostly look like a self-service flight where if you need water or anything just go and get that yourself from the counter as you can't find flight crew at their location. I was traveling with an infant and they don't provide anything for the infant except taking extra money from traveler.
565,"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Kolkata via Delhi, and I chose Air India only because it had a transit at New Delhi and I thought of meeting my friends during the huge gap between the connecting flights (6 hours). But although the Airport Authority of India did not have any problem with it, Air India restricted me from going out of the New Delhi Airport and quickly forced me to do the Security checking for the next flight. I had chosen this unclean, untimely airline which serves stale food only to use the transit time to meet my friends in Delhi which did not happen due to them. By the way, I'm an Indian citizen myself. So, whereas all the other outside Airports/Airlines allow the transit travelers to go outside in case of time gaps, it's only the problem of Air India. On top of that, the Customer Care did not pick up the phone and their website did not allow a seat preference before that."
566,✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Amritsar. Excellent customer service from Air India staff. I was late to board the plane and a senior manager made sure that I was able to catch my flight. My luggage was delivered on time too.
567,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Ahmedabad. The food and entertainment systems are not up to the mark but the crew was the best I have seen. Right from checking in till baggage collection its perfect. The hospitality shown by the crew on AI172 on 20th November flight is to be counted for.
568,"✅ Trip Verified |  Surat to New Delhi. Seats were spacious compared to Indigo and Spicejet. Departed on time but arrived late due to traffic congestion at Delhi airport. Although I faced trouble in doing web check in, I got boarding pass without any hassle at Surat airport. Meal, though complimentary, was not up to the mark (esp Idli and upma) compared to sandwich provided by Indigo and Spicejet (though not complementary); tea and yoghurt was delicious. Nice experience of having Air host in lieu of Air hostess, who was very polite, helping, and professional. Since I booked a day before, price was quite high, but still cheapest. Overall, very nice experience."
569,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Delhi. Very rude and uncooperative staff. My flight take off time was 8:50 pm and I reached the airport check-in desk at 8:09 pm. The check-in lady wasted some time but after some urging, she was willing to allow me to check-in but her supervisor standing behind her said no need to entertain me and did not allow me to check in. It was an urgent trip for me as I had to report to job the very next morning and he said:- ""if your trip was urgent you would have come earlier"". If I am spending 7000 rupees at least I can expect is to be allowed to check in if the aircraft is parked in the airport with another 40 mins of time before takeoff. It takes at least 15 min for the process of boarding to be completed and I was just 2-3 mins late to the counter closing. Not only am I highly disappointed at this but also extremely angry due to this blatant looting of money in the form of denial of service when there is 43 mins to time to taking-off. I will never choose to use the service of Air-India in future.."
570,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Lucknow. The most inconvenient flight I’ve boarded in my entire life. First, they put me in an international flight, from Delhi to Lucknow. The entire flight was full of men hardly 5 female boarded the plain other than me. I was given a seat in the middle of two creepy men constant trying to tap my hands and legs. The refreshment -  2 butter cookies and a juice carton worth 20 bucks. Disgrace! One good thing they do on domestic flights is at least serve a veg wrap & muffin - especially morning. To further add to my frustration, the porters shared the domestic luggage half an hour later on the belt, where the international luggage was put within the first 5 minutes. Half of the luggage anyway was going back in the connecting flight for the passengers. What a crazy morning! Never taking Air India again."
571,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to London via  Delhi. I was very pleased with the service going to Calcutta as the flight arrived well before time and food was good too (but could do with proper hot food as it doesn't taste good when cold, even the tea). I  wondered why they do not update the movies - same old Indian movies, also on my return to London everything was good until I received my suitcase they mishandled it and broke it. Will I get a compensation on that? "
572,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Bangalore via Mumbai. Worst flight experience. I travelled with my husband. Flight from Newark airport to Mumbai airport, seats were not comfortable, the screen and the remote was defective. We were literally fighting with the screen to select the movie or pause or play it. The remote few buttons was missing for both of us. Food was not good and bread were hard and cold. The service was also not good. Our connecting flight is from Mumbai to Bangalore. We are still waiting at the airport which forced me to share this review at this moment itself. It seems our connecting flight didn't reach airport. After such a long journey it is tiresome to wait for the next flight without any estimation and food. Will try to avoid Air India flight by heart."
573,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Delhi. I bought 3 tickets on the mobile app all seem fine then the money went off my card but received a message that the ticket was not successful. After calling to India at a massive expense i was told sorry the tickets were cancelled, I have to make a booking online rather than the App - but how can I do this the money was already taken from me. No one that can speak on the phone was willing to help - they said email and they will refund but it will take 10-15 days. This is totally and utterly ridiculous."
574,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. The flight was the worst I’ve ever travelled in. They charged me an extra 20,000 rupees at the airport. The customer service of Air India mentioned something else and when we followed exactly what the Air India people said, we were charged an extra 20,000. I am extremely disappointed as a consumer and I know for a fact that I rather pay a lot extra for another flight but I will not be travelling in Air India again. The Air India officials are extremely rude and do not know how to talk to their consumers. The flight was the most unpleasant experience I had."
575,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Bangalore. I had taken this afternoon flight hoping to arrive in the evening but however as soon as I checked in, I realized that the flight was delayed by over 2 hours and was instead to depart in the evening which was not an ideal situation even though the notification and updates were provided. So I had to kill time at the airport as there was plenty of time on my hands. The flight then took off at the new departure time and the flight was not exactly a full flight and the pushback was on time so the service was on the leisurely side. Dinner was served on this flight due to the delayed departure and during the course of the flight the pilots had kept the passengers updated regarding the course of the flight and the other details which was a good touch because not many pilots tend to do it as much as it should be done. Touchdown was also on time and baggage was swiftly collected from the belts which led to a swift embarkation. Overall, apart from the 2 hours delay which was of no serious consequence, everything else on the flight was standard and uneventful, the crew was engaging and friendly."
576,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to Mumbai. I usually travel to Bangalore for business/ work related trips and have gone by Air India and never encountered any problems. The checkin process was smooth and baggage drop without any hassles. The flight departed on time, was pretty full with an all female cabin crew who managed to do a very good job of looking after passengers. On this short segment, a hot breakfast was served (Air India serves an all vegeterian meal on all their domestic sectors) which was very good. This was an excellent, smooth flight which was handled well from start to finish. Would definitely fly with them again."
577,"Not Verified | We had flown on 27th September 2018 on Air India flight from Pune to New York via Delhi. My seat number was D45. It was a very pleasant flight. The crew was very courteous, the food was good and on the whole I would rate it as excellent. Keep up the good work."
578,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. I have come to London as a short-term student for 4 months under a fully funded Government of India and British Council Scheme, Newton-Bhabha PhD placement programme. I booked my flight from Air India office, Jor Bagh, Delhi, India. When I booked my ticket they never gave me the option of Maharaja Scholar scheme to take an extra piece of baggage. It is when I asked they issued me the same. But, I was never told that I have to book a return ticket to avail the same for my journey from London to India. And now when my ticket is booked by my husband from the same office for December 2018, they are arrogantly saying that they can't issue extra baggage under Maharaja Scholar scheme and I have to talk to UK office. I called UK office to inquire the same they are saying 'Sorry, we can't issue one' and giving me option to pay 140 pounds to take that 3rd piece of bag. Is it justified to harass a student like this???? I literally have to throw my suitcase alongwith the things in London and go back to India with so called 2 piece allowance. It's my compulsion to travel with Air India because of government funding otherwise I would be the last person to choose this airlines. I must mention the staff is so rude and arrogant to clients that they are not ready to utter options available to us. If they would have told me prior I would have booked the return ticket from India itself. Its like we are begging in front of them for everything. They have defeated my purpose of going to their office and book the ticket, it would have been better to book online in such a scenario."
579,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Chicago. This was my first and last trip with this airline. Not only are the staff incompetent, they are not honest. Our flight was initially arranged for a Saturday, they diverted the plane without telling the passengers, and instead communicated with the passengers there were ‘technical problems’ which were creating delays. The first lie was a 2 hour delay, the second a 4 hour delay, and on the third 2 hour delay which then established a cumulative 6 hour delay - at least 60 male and female passengers were at the podium at gate 26B in the Delhi airport demanding answers or plans. Air India supervisors, who had no competence, leadership, organization, or plans were found to have lied to the passengers once one of the younger employees admitted they knew all along the flight was not coming. These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all. I was embarrassed for the employees of the airline and the passengers who were from India - the riotous display the airline was unable to control or relieve tells me they have no concept of current airline practices or any consideration for customer service. "
580,"Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Delhi. First time with Air India for me. I was pretty worried because of the mixed reviews for the airline but because of the cheap price we decided to book them anyway. The check-in and boarding was not the fastest but in the end the flight was on time. Inflight entertainment had nice current hollywood and bollywood options. The service and especially the food was very good. I had mutton with rice and my girlfriend took the vegetarian option. Both meals very very good. The Aircraft had some slight signs of usage but was clean. Overall we would take Air India again because we feeled save, had good food and the overall price-performance ratio was good."
581,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Bangkok. I found the business class staff to be exceedingly friendly and courteous and professional. Upon landing the Chief Purser came around and shook everyone’s hands, remembering names and thanking us for choosing to fly with Air India. The services were fine, with a choice of alcoholic beverages and pre-dinner snacks. The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its décor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look. Entertainment choices were ok, and the seats were generally pretty comfortable. All in all, a pretty good flight with a few drawbacks."
582,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jaipur to Mumbai. I flew through Air India with a family of 7 people and total of 11 bags.  We sent all bags to be weighed in and got the tickets for pickup in Mumbai. Only to realize that they didn't tag one of our bags, and only printed out 10 stickers for the bags. 1 bag was still stuck in Jaipur while I am in Mumbai. I have to Leave for USA on August 18th. The Air India staff was highly unprofessional and said they won't get the bag back because it was our fault, and I should've watched all my bags get tags put on them. After that they asked me to pay 8000 rupees to get the bag delivered, which is close to $90. This is the second incident with Air India. First they completely broke the bottom of my bag."
583,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Goa. Delayed departure of 1h30, presenting reasons of delay of the previous flight and maintenance of the same. Interior of the  airplane, with lack of cleaning and lack of maintenance. Dirty floor due to lack of cleaning. Ceilings grimy and dirty. Armrests of the seats shake and are loose. I never expected to find a plane with 9 years in this conditions, specially from star alliance member!"
584,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Colombo via Delhi. Very disappointing trip. We are on holiday in Sri Lanka with out our luggage. Wearing the same clothes since we flew on the 27 July 2018. Said they were able to deliver the luggage 29 July but it was just a word with no meaning.  My family including my child having really hard time without our stuff. No empathy, Very irresponsible I will never recommend for anyone."
585,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Air India from Vienna to Delhi. Check in at Vienna Airport was smooth and efficient. Plane was not full, and cabin crew were largely professional & polite. There is room for improvement for the entertainment system, with lackluster movie options and only Indian music on offer. Dinner and breakfast were served on this red-eye flight - Food was standard airline fare. Departed on time & landed slightly before schedule."
586,"✅ Trip Verified | This flight was the 2nd leg of my journey from Vienna to Singapore, via Delhi. While the 1st leg was operated by a much more spacious B787, this leg was operated by a smaller and more cramped A320. Flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of aircraft. Only lunch was served on this afternoon flight - food was largely average. Surprised to find no inflight entertainment on board despite Air India not being a low cost carrier."
587,"✅ Trip Verified | Air India was actually excellent to my surprise, and heavily contrary to the views I have heard about it. I am a Star Alliance Gold member, and hence I was lucky to board with Business Class passengers. I thought I would fly with Air India in a domestic flight and it was great for Air India to join the alliance as passengers like me want an opportunity to accrue miles from star alliance flights. Check in was smooth, ground staff were courteous and kind at Coimbatore Airport and they even gave me a lounge pass for me and my mother, although there was no Air India contract lounge in Coimbatore Airport. Boarding was smooth and in a sequence with priority passengers first. Also, the crew greeted us well and the aircraft had clean interiors and clean lavatories. Food was excellent too. There's no Star Alliance carrier in North America (United/Air Canada) that offers complimentary meals on a domestic flight. Also, the legroom was excellent, especially for a person who is 6 ft 4 inches. The crew were very kind to offer my mother a blanket and some medicine when she felt sick. Overall, I enjoyed it. Hats off to Air India and hope they improve more even further! Only thing I suggest is at least provide in-flight wifi either for free or for purchase to not bore passengers."
588,"Not Verified |  My experience with Air India was terrible. My family and I had to wait for more than 3 hours because the numbers on our tickets didn’t match theirs, even though we were still on their list of boarding passengers. Our tickets were issued from Turkish Airlines since we had a connecting flight from Istanbul, Turkey to Mumbai and then to Ahmedabad. We have previously dealt with this same situation when we were going from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, but when we called Turkish Airlines and explained this situation in front of the Air India staff, we were immediately given our tickets. However, this time, we had to pay for our tickets again. Air India was simply cheating us by making a huge deal out of a small mistake that they themselves have made with our tickets. We had to pay double the amount for our tickets only to recieve the same treatment and service. I would rate Air India zero stars if I could. I will never board Air India ever in my life."
589,✅ Trip Verified |  I had travelled on this morning flight from Mumbai to Bangalore on the A319. The web check in worked well and so was able to print the boarding pass in advance without any technical issues. The flight itself was a pretty full flight and the flight was delayed by 40 mins which was a tad disappointing but of no real consequence. The crew and staff were very friendly and courteous and were quite prompt to respond to requests. The seat was quite comfortable with great seat pitch which has to be one of the biggest plus points of the carrier. During the flight breakfast was also served which was good and filling followed by tea/coffee. Touchdown was very smooth and the disembarkation process and retrieving baggage was no hassle. Would not hesitate to fly again.
590,✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Bhopal. The worst of all flights.The staff is rude and not customer friendly. They didnt let around 20 people to board the flight even when we were on time. They wasted our time so that they can mark us late. They wont even refund your money The worst part is they wont even let you exit. Even after cancelling your flight they got problem with you exiting the airport. There are other competitive flights with customer friendly staff. I would prefer to use other airlines to avoid all the drama.
591,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to New Delhi. Traveling for first time with Air India on international sector and I think this is the worst of all flights i have taken internationally. Unfriendliness of staff is  seen even before the flight has taken off. On top, they seem so rude. I am traveling with a 6yo and every other flight I have taken so far with my son (Delta, Air France, unites, Lufthansa, American Airlines) have been so friendly and helpful but it’s a different story here. Plus the flight seems so uncomfortable. It’s so hot, on asking they have been asking to wait since half an hour now. My son has asked for water 3 Times now but alas no one is listening us. Hating it already, plus now they announce technical issue in flight. Never ever again am I flying in air India. "
592,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to Birmingham via Delhi. Air India offered the worst possible service on the return flight. It all started when airline agent didn't check the baggage through to the final destination and I had to pick up the entire lot (6 bags) plus 2 hand luggage, baby changing bag and the laptop bag also while handling a toddler. Add to that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours from Delhi to Birmingham and the onward flight from Birmingham to Belfast missed. Had to wait for several hours before some lady with half information and no patience booked a hotel for us to stay overnight and booked the next flight at 18.45 next day (even when there were 3 other flights from the same airline available at earlier times). Add to this, we were kicked out of the hotel by 12:00 forcing us to go to the airport 7 hours earlier and spend time with a toddler till the flight came. Flight was delayed by 25 min...(fortunately it didn't get cancelled) and we reached our destination 24 hours later than planned. Worst airline, worst service and absolute indifference from the staff."
593,Not Verified | Surat to Frankfurt via New Delhi. Both the filghts were on time. The transit in New Delhi was quite easy and seamless. Food provided on both the flights was pretty decent for an economy class. IFE is very good. It has a huge collection of bollywood movies. This is the fourth time I am flying on this route and had a very good experience with this airline.
594,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Washington via New Delhi. In flight services like food & beverage and cabin crew behavior are appreciated.  To top it all was the AI counter in Washington Airport near luggage claim center. And the lady in the counter was of real help, when we needed it most. We certainly recommend you."
595,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi. My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalid…and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.) Verdict: I had quite a few other flights with Air India last year and there is always something that does not work. It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline."
596,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew from Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) to New Delhi, India on non stop Air India flight Number AI 104 in Business Class on April 11, 2018. After taking off from Washington, D.C. lunch was served around 12:30 P.M. After lunch the dinner was served around 9:30 P.M. almost after 9 hours. In these 9 hours there was no food service at all. They did not care to offer even a light snack or a sandwich. for nine hours and this was in the Business Class, we do not know what they did in the Economy Class. When asked the staff about this, we were told that they are suppose to serve only two meals in such a long flight. We can understand you serve two major meals but how about some snacks etc. in nine hours. It would have been fine but since I am a diabetic and need to eat some thing on regular intervals. But sorry that is the only food service they offer. Wanted to talk to the Supervisor about it and was told the supervisor would come to talk to you but of course nobody came to talk to us at all until we landed in New Delhi as if you simply do not care and if you are diabetic then it is your problem. We have flown in Business Class on so many different airlines around the world and have never experienced such a poor food service. Have you ever compared your business class service with other airlines? How can you compete with them with this kind of service? They serve food, drinks and snacks throughout the flight in Business Class without even asking. No wonder Air India is losing money. Who would like to pay this kind of money for Business Class and get this kind of service. It is surprising, at one time Air India was known for it's food service. We were totally dissatisfied."
597,"✅ Trip Verified | Kathmandu to Colombo via New Delhi. I had a truly unforgettable experience with Air India - in its worst kind. In fact, two awful transit experiences in New Delhi from Kathmandu en route to Colombo and return. Both initial departure flights on separate days were delayed, conveniently resulting in my unexpected ""royal"" transit treatment in New Delhi! On my way to Colombo, the Delhi transit desk staff blankly told us that we had missed our connecting flight and simply would not board me on the next Sri Lankan Air with the excuse that this was a split ticket. Instead a staff member gave me a few numbers to call for the issuance of a new boarding pass. Eventually advising me it's best to purchase a new ticket as I was pressed for time. He even handed me a 'delay certificate' (w annotation at the bottom ""We thank you for flying Air India and wish you a happy journey) that could be used as proof in the event I would like to be reimbursed for the new ticket purchased! Ultimately, I was stuck at the Delhi transit desk for 5+ hours (along with other angry customers), even after paying out of my pocket for a new connecting ticket as I was made to endlessly for the issuance of a new boarding pass. Save yourself some misery and avoid Air India like a plague!"
598,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to Dubai via Mumbai. Good, better as compared to other Indian airlines. On time departure and arrival. Food was ok. More leg space and kind staff. Much better than expectation."
599,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kathmandu to Colombo via Delhi / Chennai. Never in my life have I had poor customer service like air India. As I was flying Kathmandu to Colombo Air India had me routed through India changing flights from Delhi to Chennai, not informing me of needing a transit visa, and they would not board me. I was offered no refund, no exchange and told I should have known the rules and I can ""go book another flight on my credit card"" leaving me stuck in kathmandhu for over 3 days. Offering no compassion for the situation marking me as a ""No Show"" and telling me I had 30 minutes to go back into the city to the air India office before the closed to try and resolve the issue, which I did and was offered no remorse or help. I hope they train your staff to show a bit more sincerity."
600,✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Sydney. It was a dreadful and nightmarish experience for the second time in two years - to travel by this airline! My latest experience was the worst and beyond any logical explanation. Delhi to Sydney on 5 June was delayed for 2.30 hours for reasons best known to them. Then on arrival in Sydney - my luggage was missing. It’s a direct flight from Delhi to Sydney - how can the luggage go missing? There was a long wait at Sydney airport to for the passengers to lodge the complaint. It’s two days since I arrived and there is no sign of luggage in cold and wintry Sydney!  The numbers they had given to track the luggage does not respond! What are the poor passengers supposed to do? 
601,"❌ Not Verified |  London to Mumbai. My happy vacation has been turned into horrifying experience. Flew Delta code share Virgin Atlantic from Minneapolis to London, delayed start led to us missing our connecting Jet Airways flight unfortunately got re-booked on Air India by Delta. I landed with my family in Mumbai on May 29th and all six of our bags didn't arrive. Followed procedure and constantly called support and informed on May 29th my bags will reach on May 30th. Bags haven't arrived yet. Even after repeatedly informing I have a flight to catch on May 31st at 7:30 am. So, here we are with no clothes, medicine toiletries, extra stress and not sure of financial loss if i have to change my Delhi flight tickets. WORST experience ever. My second and for sure my last trip on Air India"
602,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Air India from Surat to Sydney via Delhi. Both flights on time, ground-staff and cabin crew very friendly and attentive, IFE was fantastic. Food on the one of the best I've experienced. Transit in Delhi was fast, and everything from boarding to disembarkation went smoothly. "
603,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Newark via Mumbai. I booked a round trip ticket for two people directly with the airline.  At that time I provided them with all our details, including our Star Alliance MileagePlus account numbers. After the trip was completed, I checked our accounts and Air India had failed to credit us with the return mileage, almost 20,000.  What has ensued is the worst example of customer service I have ever encountered in 60 years of flying.  After dozens of emails and several phone calls, I have yet to be able to find anyone who will do anything to rectify the situation, in any department at the airline.  Not only will they not live up to their obligations as a member of Star Alliance, and not only will they not even supply me with the details of my return flight (eticket number, seat number, flight number), they have now totally stopped responding to my repeated attempts.  It is a mystery to me how the Star Alliance has allowed this incompetent and unprofessional airline in.   Avoid Air India at all costs; if something goes wrong, you can depend on them to do nothing for you."
604,✅ Trip Verified |  Jaipur to Delhi. Unprofessional way of handling things. 8:25 flights gets delayed to 9:15. And after more delay it flies at 10:30 reaches Delhi. After the pilot misses the parking slot and we wait for more 40 mins and to get the new parking slot. Unbelievable it is considered to be one of the premier airlines in India. You guys are not worth it. For a journey of 60 mins we just waste 3 hours and 35 mins. No one can take your place.
605,"✅ Trip Verified | 
I flew back from Delhi on flight AI0111 at 14:00 on Thursday 10/5/2018. The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with Air India and will never do so in the future. "
606,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Delhi to London Heathrow. What a horrible airline. Never ever again am I going to book Air India. Webcheck in has absolutely no meaning, in fact the queue for bag drop off is probably more than the normal. Takes nothing less than 1.5 hr before you reach the counter and the chances are you may be asked to go to another counter and then come back - happened to 2-3 people right in front of me. At least 8-10 entertainment systems are broken in the flight and the attendants don’t care or do anything other than saying sorry sir this seat entertainment is broken. Despite being an Indian airline the food they serve is so horrible - it’s just unbelievable. So many other international airlines serve 10x better food. Staff courtesy - Ask them for a cup of coffee / tea and look at their displeased expressions. Being an Indian myself, I am embarrassed by the fact that this is our own international / national airline. Will try my best to avoid this airline in future."
607,✅ Trip Verified |  Kochi to Dubai. Air India upgraded me to Business class. Flight were on time. Food was excellent and staff behavioral was nice. Overall happy with them.
608,✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Singapore. ( Mumbai-Singapore in Air India / Singapore TO LAX was  United). When I checked in Mumbai airport on 5th May 2018 I was surprised that the Air India counter person is asking me the Singapore visa. I told him that I am not exiting in Singapore and it is a connecting flight ( layover of 2 hours) and for such transit visa is not required.  My question how these guys are not so knowledgeable when they sit in that counter. In addition he is telling me United Baggage allowance may be 1. I told him baggage allowance rule will apply on the original flight rules and not the 2nd flight. So I had a real bad experience.
609,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Air India from Hong Kong to Seoul. Although the airline uses new aircraft's, in my case it was a 787 Dreamliner, and food was good. I found the crew very impolite and the customer service was therefore quite poor, the staff did not share a single smile throughout both flights. Moreover, when I asked a question, I got a very rude ""No"", without any excuse. I also found it quite weird that on my flight to Hong Kong, the captain did not even greet the passengers as it is usually done."
610,✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Delhi. One of the worst experiences ever. The media consoles didn't work. I had the longest flight ever. We have complained them about the media consoles. They didn't function till 2 hours the flight has started. They have repeatedly rebooted the consoles and even after that it didn't work. There wasn't any communication. The food is also not up to the mark. By the end of the flight the toilets wouldn't flush. I will never fly by them again.
611,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore - Mumbai and New Delhi - Singapore. Singapore to Mumbai on the 787, entertainment was mediocre. No smiles from flight attendants who seemed to dislike their job. However this leg wasn't the big issue. New Delhi to Singapore was the big issue. Paid at the time of booking to select my seat and upon check-in at the airport, staff told me that the seat has been given to someone else. When I questioned him why this was so, he said ""Yes you have paid to choose that seat, but it doesn't mean it's confirmed."". When I argued further with him on this, he resorted to saying ""It's not my fault!"". On the plane, the tray table was horribly stained with curry. Had to ask the flight attendants countless times for help until I got a few napkins from them and had to clean it up myself. The flight attendant was irritated with me and started treating me rudely for the rest of the flight. Food was terrible as well. I am not picky with airlines, as long as they are decent. I have flown many different airlines from all six continents. However, Air India the one airline that is far from any acceptable standards and truly does not deserve the title of being a Star Alliance member. I've heard bad reviews before and I thought I could handle it. A joke of a national airline."
612,✅ Trip Verified |  Coimbatore to Bangalore. The flight was neat and clean. I think it was a part of the newest fleet it ordered for its short haul flights operated by alliance air. The staff were courteous and served well tending to the passengers. The food was horrible though. It was a sandwich with fried cabbages. The flight duration was however only 35 minutes and hence manageable.
613,"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm not sure if there is no lounge for business class passenger travelling from Kolkata to Mumbai (domestic). Well, I asked the lady upon checking in, she said I can just go in (based on my experience with other airlines there will be an invitation card). So I walked in to the Travel Lounge or something on the first floor, I showed staff my boarding pass and asked politely if I can access. She asked for my AMEX card and then she just said ""No Indian only"".  I just wanted to grab some hot coffee anyway so I went down to Coffee Bean to get one. Then I emailed to Air India's CS team, no reply after almost a week. The aircraft was pretty old and badly maintained. The food, geez.. I'll just get the coffee. I don't want to use gross to describe them because others enjoyed them I guess, but it's not delicious, like at all. I wonder why they are even a Star Alliance member airlines. Not up to standard at all from the moment I have checked in my flight. Oh, no in-flight entertainment either due to the old configuration of the aircraft. Nah, doesn't matter. I just wanted some extra space from the crowd."
614,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Delhi on 29th March 2018. Flight was punctual, aircraft was new and well maintained. IFE at my seat was not working, I was offered another seat with working one (I opted to stay back as I wanted to sleep). Drinks were served with decent  options followed by hot food with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and breakfast before landing. Only thing which bothered me was absence of smile and courtesy on Cabin crew.  I understand the job is quite demanding but a little smile, thank you, please etc. can bring a lot of change. After all, the cabin crew is the face of any airline. Being 6 feet tall I had ample of space to spread my legs. Overall it was a pleasant experience."
615,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to New Delhi. I was on a business class transfer (flown from Newark via United), to catch this flight. Boarding Staff Supervisor told me that I have to go Economy as the flight was full. I had the  Business Class Boarding Pass in my hand. I get leg cramps on long flights so I pleaded not to make change. I was not aware of my rights in that situation and just wanted to leave (after snow storm.) Initially he refused to Air India boarding pass but I stood firm not to accept any change. Finally, Supervisor gave in after few back and forth. What a harassment? This was my first Air India flight and probably the last one. Will never travel Air India again."
616,"✅ Trip Verified | Delhi to Singapore. I have been flying Air India for 4 years regularly but on international flights the staff seem to be getting worse and worse. On a flight which departs at 11 pm they insist on serving drinks from 11.45 to 12.45 in the night. You request the meal with your drink the person serving my section refused saying he will get it after drinks are served. I asked for a second refill of red wine and made the mistake of asking the stewardess serving the seat behind me. First she refused as it was not her section when i looked at her she said I could not serve a second glass of wine for 2 hours. I asked for a feedback form she refused and walked away. All in all, an unhappy experience."
617,"✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to New York via Delhi. The flight from Mumbai to Delhi was on time and dinner was served on this sector and while the IFE was working initially, it encountered some problems before landing but as this was a short sector it was overlooked. The flight leg from DEL to JFK was completely full and on this flight boarding started one hour earlier and on this 15 hour flight the seats were comfortable although after flying for a long time, signs of age were visible. The cabin crew were frequently checking on the passengers and provided three meal service on this flight which was very good and ensured that regular food/drink supplies were there. The crew themselves were quite positive and nice throughout the flight. Would recommend them and was good value for money."
618,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Mumbai via Delhi. The return leg of this flight was around 85% full however the service on this sector provided by the crew was excellent. The flight took off on time which was followed by refreshments/lunch service. The crew were very friendly and full of smiles during the service and after lunch the cabin was dimmed during the rest period. Regular food was offered and the quantity and quality of the food provided was excellent. The seat was fairly comfortable, although showing signs of age which is expected when it has been in service for over a decade. The IFE may not been as vast containing 42738 odd movies like some other airlines but it was adequate enough during the trip and I even managed to watch a couple of movies but was unable to sleep due to infants crying continously and parents unable to pacify their babies but I was still able to rest for 2 hours or so and arrival into Delhi was on time. The remaining leg from DEL to BOM was on the star alliance Boeing 777 which was cool and a hot snack was offered on this route. Landing was on time and baggage was delivered smoothly on the carousel. Thank you Air India for a comfortable trip replete with good service. Would not hesitate to fly with them again."
619,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pune to Delhi, the aircraft is 8.6 years old with no inflight entertainment system. I guess Air India do not provide Entertainment system in domestic flight as of now. Also No choice of food for dinner, only veg meal was provided. The food was okay. Fortunately i got the first row in economy class (4D) so got good leg room."
620,✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Delhi. Seat Comfort and Meal was good. Flight left on time and staff did their best to serve on board. To my surprise hot dinner was served on the domestic leg of international flight and the meal quality was pretty good. Seat pitch and comfort was better than average and I was quite happy with the flying experience.
621,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Mumbai return. The plane was modern with adequate legroom between seats and seats were rather comfortable. The biggest problem I noted was that the Inflight Entertainment system were not working properly. I sat in one seat and noticed the jack for the headphones would not accept my personal noise cancelling headphones or even the airlines' own headphones. The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all. Otherwise the planes are modern with fair catering and flight attendants who do their job while not being friendly. There are better airlines to fly between the US and India, though."
622,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Delhi. Generous seat pitch. Air India's 788 have 33 inch seat pitch with good leg room. The flight left on time and food quality was quite good. Service was average but nothing to complain. Air India can do better on cleanness and maintenance of plane. Overall, I was happy with flight and service."
623,"✅ Trip Verified |  New Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata. First time flying with Air India. Was a bit excited when I found out I will be flying in the  Boeing 787-8  to Kolkata, and from there, connecting flight to Dhaka in an Airbus A319. Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom. The onboard served snack wasn't good on this one. There was dry, cold Singara and cake. The plane made some noises during the flight. This Aircraft, perhaps ,wasn't properly maintained. Anyways, landed in Dhaka after a 1 hr flight. Overall experience was really good."
624,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pantnagar to Delhi. Before booking the ticket, I checked past week departure history of the flight using Air India website. The website showed departed on time which made me book the flight. While entering the airport, a security guard informed that the flight is not flying from weeks due to bad weather conditions during that season. I was shocked and worried since I needed to board an international flight from Delhi. Well, I inquired from Air India staff about today's flight status and got a diplomatic answer saying uncertainty in flying. The flight was delayed by 1 hour approximately. After landing Delhi airport, I checked the status of the same flight online. Surprisingly, it was not updated and showing that departure and arrival are scheduled on time. The web-based flight status service was showing incorrect information again and created huge trouble for me. Not to mention that the behavior of Air India staff at inquiry room is completely unacceptable. Also, Air India did not inform me in advance about the flight status via email or SMS. In conclusion, I would definitely not recommend Air India to anyone."
625,✅ Trip Verified |  Pune to Raipur via Hyderabad. They've no respect for time the flight was delayed by 4 hours. The staff is disrespectful. Have been delaying the ETD every half an hour to a total of more that 4 hours. This way first and last flight with Air India - can never be professional.
626,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kathmandu to Delhi. How this airline is still operational is beyond my belief. Absolutely pathetic service right from the check in counter. If you're openly entertaining economy class passengers in the business class line, what's the point of having a separate line? These are the basic facilities that you pay for when you buy a business class ticket. Also, why is Air India the only airline where you cannot enter the executive lounge? Are they saving that much money that they can't even renew their lounge contract? Absolutely filthy aircraft and ill-mannered crew. You've definitely lost a customer for life."
627,✅ Trip Verified | Flew Bhopal to Mumbai with Air India. Kindly understand the value of time of people! Flight was delayed by 30mins from its scheduled time. Luggage took 25 mins to be on belt. Belt number wasn't mentioned on flight itself which normally other flights do! No value of time of other people. I missed a connecting train which was an hour later because of this.
628,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Mumbai to Bhubaneswar. I was very surprised by the service, the whole Air India team was welcoming. There were more flight attendants than I see usually with other airlines. Each one was taking care of every customer. Most of the luggage lifting and its arrangement was done by them (unlike other airlines). Special care was taken of kids and elderly people. The airplanes have much spaced and are comfortable. (Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today. The ticket rates are competitive and sometimes cheaper than others. "
629,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Newark to Mumbai. The worst airline one can ever travel with. My seat was not reclining nor was my TV working and when I requested the crew he said - ""madam please I am busy"". When I complained to the other crew member he said he would help me and after that both the flight attendants started avoiding me. Travelling for 14 and a half hours without TV and it was not just me, there were so many other passengers having the same problem. They behaved as if they doing us a favor. Will never recommend Air India to anyone, no matter how good a deal you get online."
630,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bhubaneswar to Mumbai. A mixed bag with Air India. Flew HYD to BBI and back to BOM. The outbound flight was fine, left right on time with an on time arrival into BBI. They served a reasonable lunch on board though minimal smiles from the crew. Aircraft was new and seemed clean. The return flight BBI to BOM, a different story. Arrived at airport 90 minutes before departure and told that flight was on time. Proceeded to gate and waited for aircraft which was not insight. All signage said that flight was on time. At departure time no aircraft and went online to find out flight is 2 hours delayed. No Air India staff present in a small tiny airport. Flight finally came and we took off- no explanation or apology from the crew. Food awful on this afternoon flight and crew barely smiled. Multiple people with missed connections. Only positive is luggage arrived in 5 minutes on belt in both cities."
631,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. Earlier this month I reviewed the outbound sector of my trip, this review covers the inbound sector on the 31st January. Although the plane was a Boeing 787, it was quite an old one and hence badly maintained. The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew? I imagine not because otherwise these reviews would not be published."
632,"✅ Trip Verified |  Paris to Goa via Delhi. It's the worst company of all time and to avoid ! 10 hours late departing, not a smile or even a precise explanation. On the return we missed our connection. So we were obliged to sleep one night in Delhi in a hotel without window. The staff really was not professional, no smile or even compassion."
633,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Bangkok to Birmingham via Delhi. Never fly with Air India. I stated I had certain dietry requirements when I booked, also via email, the app and at check in. When I got my meals none of them suited my dietry requirements. I didnt eat for over 18 hours due to this. The staff were dreadful, when pressing the staff requirement button no-one came, you had to actually go to the back of the plane and interrupt their mothers meeting to which they were extreamly rude about. They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen. Both times we let the staff know to which they didn't do much about or even seem to care. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. "
634,✅ Trip Verified |  Ahmedabad to  Delhi. Air India is quite possibly the worst airline I have ever flown.  When we initially checked in for our flight in Chicago to our departure in Ahmedabad. The policies they state on their website do not correlate what the company actually adheres to i.e baggage policy. During the flight they have the worst customer service. I waited over 20 minutes for an air hostess after pressing the button and when I asked for water when they had a chance I was scowled at and not to mention they never even brought the water. Overall I would never recommend this airline to anyone flying. 
635,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst. I suspect that no one in the airline really cares about receiving poor reviews, wouldn't it be nice if some one did?"
636,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been travelling to New York for three years and decided to try Air India. I have taken this flight twice now and both have been the worst travel experiences of my life. I have never complained with any other airline but the staff this airline hires are so rude all the time. Being the largest Indian airline you would expect them to be hospitable, instead they are just the opposite. The staff actually laughed at my face today on a request made by me. I would suggest everyone to take any airline but this one. It’s only negative vibes and your entire travel experience is ruined.It’s only negative vibes "
637,✅ Trip Verified | Flew Air India from Mumbai to Hyderabad. Excellent leg room and seats are good. Ground and Cabin staff are very friendly and courteous. Food provided is delicious. Reached the destination on time.
638,"✅ Trip Verified |  Business Class, Mumbai to Bangkok. They lost my bags at the Mumbai Airport, which is another terribly run organization and should be avoided at all costs. My bags have now been missing over 72 hours. They open a case through their Airport baggage organization, which is contracted to help Air India with lost baggage claims. It also allows Air India to evade responsibility and accountability. If you try to contact Air India customer service to discuss compensation / details of your lost bag, they tell you they can't help. They direct you to Bangkok. Bangkok gives you the Air India policy and tells you it's completely non-negotiable. They say they don't have the power to do anything, any changes must be done by Air India, and they direct you to call Air India. This allows Air India to completely evade any negotiation or accountability. So far as a business class passenger with no bags for 72 hours+ I've been given a paltry 50 pounds, about 65 USD at the time of posting. Should be enough to buy a decent pair of pants. If this company wants to call itself a premier airline, they need to go back to elementary school for customer service. I've heard that the Mumbai airport which they base out of has a huge issue with lost baggage. Save yourself the nightmare of losing your bags overseas. Avoid this joke of an airline. "
639,✅ Trip Verified | Birmingham to Chennai via Delhi. Cabin staff not very helpful or willing to even give you a drink of water. My flight from Birmingham got delayed which meant I missed my flight to Chennai. It took 3 hours just to get an other ticket to Chennai. Really bad customer service. They don’t care about anything.
640,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to New York. My flight to FK was good, with no problems. However on the return flight, I was not given my confirmed seat of 18D and instead was placed in a middle seat 30J. I explained that I need to get up frequently, but I was told that the ground crew made the change. The entertainment system did not work. Flight attendant came by and made one attempt to fix it by pushing the same buttons I had been pushing. Most importantly, they did not have my Gluten Free meal. I was told that it needed to be ordered ahead of time. I showed my eticket that said Gluten Free confirmed. The Flight attendant then brought me a meal that was not marked Gluten Free. She assured me it was ok, but could not tell me all the ingredients. I explained that if I ate something with gluten I would be very sick. She did try her best, and brought me fruit, but I was not able to eat a proper meal for the duration of the flight."
641,✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Hyderabad. Almost 30 inflight entertainment are not working on the flight including mine.  I requested multiple times to reset but none of the attendants came back responded that IFE has an issue and will not work. Worst thing is we can't even sleep on 16hr flight due to white light from screens. 
642,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chandigarh to Kulu. Excellent service from Air India. Bags delivered, food is good, seat space and service is very good. Staff on Air India answer to a call attendant button. Flights was on time."
643,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Madrid. Worst cabin crew ever. It left Delhi on time and reached Madrid on time. Aircraft was not as clean, seats were dirty and some of the armrests quite loose. Cabin crew attitude and their behaviour with passengers  leaves much to be desired. On three occasions they served drinks or food coming from behind rather from front, no eye contact, no smile, nothing. In the first serving they gave options of non-veg/veg/continental food but in the second serving only option was Indian food which was too spicy to be eaten by a person living in Europe. I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood. If ever I will fly with them again is just because this is the only direct flight from Madrid to Delhi using a Boeing 787 and with a meal or two in my bag."
644,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Mumbai. A decent flight - good food, good leg space in economy and service on check-in professional polite and good. The flight took off and landed on time. The toilets were clean. Overall pleasantly surprised given the negative reviews.  Will recommend and will fly again to India"
645,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I arrived 10 mins after the boarding started, and was told to queue in line to board despite being a business class passenger. Thankfully another member of staff acknowledged my business class status and allowed me to board first. Due to technical reasons the flight was delayed by 45 minutes after boarding was completed. Staff were really nice looked after the people in business class and offered drinks and food. After take off, food was served and the food was really tasty. Only thing that bothered me was that Air India doesn't serve alcohol in the domestic sector. Layover in Delhi was good and efficient, and soon we were ready for take off. Crew took our meal choices and preferred drinks after take of. This sector they had alcohol. Decided to skip the late night dinner and just had a glass of champagne and got a nice sleep of 4 hours. Overall a good airline and would recommend."
646,✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Delhi. TV didn't work the whole flight.  Tray and armrest was broken. I could barely eat food. Recliner didn't recline fully leading to back pain. Cabin crew failed to respond when called. Bottom of my checkin bag was torn. There is no in-flight wifi available for such a long flight.  I am never flying Air India again and this is my 1st and last time.
647,"✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Mumbai via Delhi. I always had a good opinion about Air India international flights in-spite of several inputs from family and friends not to fly Air India, however I experienced this during my recent travel. The crew were extremely impolite and not hospitable. They refused to serve non-veg when asked for. They asked me to weigh the baggage at a counter and at that point of time it was well within the baggage allowance, however at the point of check in the baggage showed an excess and I was charged a $100 dollars unnecessarily as penalty. To double check this I weighed the baggage as soon as I got home and found it was just 0.5 kg in excess. The entertainment unit is the only source of entertainment on a long flight however in spite of repeated requests to the crew of a dysfunctional monitor nobody bothered to rectify it. On the whole I had a miserable experience flying Air India. Feel really disappointed and cheated."
648,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Delhi, the Boeing 787 is simply a joy. The ability to play around with the window dimmer is amazing. Unfortunately though the cabin crew keeps the cabin dark all the time, even though it’s a day flight. It’s so easy for them to control it compared to the manual blinds. Service was so so, while the food was average for business class standards. The seat, however, was sufficiently wide and comfortable with USB and power available. The IFE was not as good as Emirates or SQ, but it was adequate for me. The supplied headphones could be better."
649,"✅ Trip Verified | Compared to my Air India flights in the past (for instance in 2006) I recently experienced an airline that has improved considerably. The Delhi to Srinagar aircraft looked new and clean. The legroom was generous, and there was a newspaper at every seat. The breakfast was delicious! The flight back from Srinagar to Delhi was still good (tasty lunch and, again, friendly cabin crew) but a bit less convincing. The plane was probably ten years older than the first one, and the general impression was marred by the smelly and shabby washroom."
650,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kochi to Melbourne. Air India takes you to your destination for a moderate price. Not very cheap though. They feed you many times with plenty of food. Otherwise, not very happy with the service. Poor quality of service especially from the older staff. I travelled alone with my 6 month old, and they never bothered to attend my call bells. I had to resort to the help offered from other travellers. Very unhappy. However, on my connection from Delhi (it was a flight to Dubai) I noted that service to Gulf region especially the ones staffed with men are doing a great job."
651,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Delhi. They changed my seat in very last minute and if I don't want to change back, I have to pay additional 50$. This was not conveyed to me at the time of booking or web check-in. At airport while collecting my boarding pass this was done - this is very rude. Also I have change my own baggage when I am changing flight thought my entire journey was with Air India. Most of the in flight entertainment systems onboard  not working."
652,"✅ Trip Verified | Not a pleasant experience. The seats, the equipments look old and dirty, you wouldn't want to look at the magazines as they looked like they had been there forever. I took the morning flight when I flew to Osaka and noon flight when I returned. The breakfast was terrible, but the lunch on the return flight was quite good, a bit beyond my expectation. The cabin crew delivered the worst service I have ever experienced. No smile on their face, when I stop one of them for a cup of tea, they look annoyed and not willing to do so. Waste and garbage on all desks as the crew didn't care to collect them when they saw them. I actually brought my own tray of finished food to the crew and saw them sitting chatting. No one checked your seatbelt, no one came round to make sure your seat was upright when the plane took off and landed. Conclusion: Acceptable environment, not bad food, terrible service."
653,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to New York via Delhi. They gave me a privilege to carry a 3rd piece of luggage for free, and Make my trip personnel said I don't need to incur any other expenses regarding the luggage while I was booking my ticket. While checking my baggage at Air India counter, the staff asked me to pay the tax (in Indian Rupees) for my 3rd piece luggage!  The Air India counter personnel don't accept Debit/Credit card either, and also they did not give me any receipt after paying so-called tax. I had to exchange USD for Indian Rupees and pay them while the flight reporting time was ticking at it's ending time. I was able to board the flight only because it delayed! I still don't know if I really paid the tax. However, the flight service is as usual worse."
654,"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Mumbai, flight was good, seats just average, some seats were broken and you can see stick with tapes. Food was good, cabin crew was nice. Plane took off 15 minutes late but luckily reach 25 minutes before time. Initially TV screens were not working, but then pilots reboot the system during take off and every thing was fine. Take off and Landing was smooth. Media content was somewhat old, so please be mindful."
655,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Milan return via Rome. Delhi to Milan flight the aircraft quality is good, good legroom, comfortable seats, food good, cabin crew especially male stewards were good. The flight was on time. On the way back the flight was delayed a bit but mostly due to luggage handling. But a staff onboard literally threw the dinner plate at my fellow passengers, and when i had gone to submit my used glass of water her behavior was appalling. By the end of the flight the aisle was all filthy because the staff didnt bother to pickup the waste. There seemed a tendency to overlook and treat passengers with unprofessionalism as majority were Indians, but considering expats too were flying with us such behavior was a disgrace and not reflective of our culture."
656,"✅ Verified Review | Awful. First, the divider between the business class seats were absolutely filthy. No WiFi service on board. In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat. In that seat, the entertainment system failed to work. This was a 15 hour flight that I flew business class and paid over $4000 for a ticket on. I would have rather traveled premium economy on United. The experience would have been much better. My complaint to the airline came back as ""yes, we agree that everything happened just as you said it, but you need to deal with it since it was a one time thing."" I will never, ever fly them again."
657,"✅ Verified Review |  Raipur to Bangalore via Delhi. Worst experience ever. Our connecting flight got preponed and there was no support from the airline. We faced the cancellation of indigo as well, but thanks to them that they themselves rebooked the other flight and sent us the details saying if we want any change, there is option for that. The problems we faced with Air India - Customer service guys said that they can't help and asked to call at the airport but declined to give number of airport.  Airport guys gave some other number and asked to call their admin office or asked us to go to the office for further details. No one picked the call for 2 hours in the admin office and then told that we have to call back later. Finally when we requested that we have urgent work and have to reach on monday for office they re booked the tickets and asked us to collect the tickets from the office within half an hour. Later on request they mailed it. Request you not to torture the passengers and make their experience worst with Air India."
658,"✅ Verified Review | Boarding was quick, considering the number of passengers waiting to be boarded. I'm impressed with the seats. They're comfortable, had nice cushions, and most important the leg space was amazing. I had never flown in any airline which had so much leg space in Economy. They had only veg food. Why would you not have non-veg? This was very strange. The choice of European cuisine was limited. Overall, it was a great flight. After a long time, I was able to sleep very well."
659,"✅ Verified Review |  Amritsar to Delhi. The snacks provided on the flight of just an hour is amazing. Great service keep it up. North American airlines are nowhere close to the service provided by Air India, I really enjoyed the hospitality."
660,✅ Verified Review |  London to Delhi. An excellent service and experience. This was my first time travelling with AI and I was amazed with service from ground staff to onboard. I'm looking forward flying with AI again in future.
661,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Kochi to Dubai. My first experience of Air India's Dreamliner fleet, it was fabulous, for a change the in-flight services and crew were absolutely superb, just like the way you get treated in premium routes like London-Kochi, superb experience. Seats were wide enough, superb legroom, good food, nice service, superb interiors and amazing flight. Keep it up Air India."
662,"✅ Verified Review | I'm not sure if service on this sector has always been mediocre with Air India, but I am definitely less than satisfied with the service I was given from the airline on one of their most significant international routes. Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM. Mind you, I've travelled with AI before too and was not pleased those times either!"
663,"✅ Verified Review | Flight departed half hour late, arrived 15 mins behind schedule. The meal served onboard was very filling and sufficient. Seat pitch was nice and the crew was professional. Seats were a little worn out but was still ok for a 2 hour flight. The crew were professional and not rude. Tea / coffee was served after the meals. Overall the flight was worth the money."
664,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Srinigar (Kashmir) far exceeded our expectations. Check-in at Delhi Terminal 3 was swift and efficient, the aircraft departed on time and arrived slightly ahead of scehdule. The aircraft was spotlessly clean and the cabin crew thoroughly professional (particularly in relation to safety checks) and courteous. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that despite being only 90 minute mid-morning flight, a complimentary cooked meal with choice of dishes and drinks was served and cleared away in the short time available. All this for a fare that would make the cheapest European budget airline seem somewhat expensive. Sadly few foreign tourists are visiting Kashmir these days, so the flight was very much geared for Indian nationals having cause to fly to/from Delhi, but can only conclude that with two rival Indian arilines operating this route, competition really is driving up standards. Based on our experience of this flight, we would have no hesitation in booking Air India again for our next internal flight in India."
665,"✅ Verified Review | This was the first and the last time we chose to fly Air India so perhaps the first sentence sayes it all. The positives - there was good leg room on the seats, the flights departed on time. However the rest I'm afraid then went downhill. The cabins were grubby, I had to ask numerous times for a cloth to wipe my area and screen as there were finger marks of old food still on the screen. We felt that the crews on all the legs were all quite surly and really did not want to be there and anything was a bit too much of a bother. Once the meal service was done they all huddled in the galley and sat and read. On the transit at Delhi the ground staff were not much better at the customer service experience either, we were met with rude agents barking orders where to go as we had not heard an announcement due to having queued in security for an hour. All in all, not a good experience when compared with the other airlines we have flown with- Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia, Etihad and whilst they may be cheaper it may certainly be true that you get what you pay for but for us - never again."
666,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chennai via Mumbai. I had to book with Air India as there tickets were on sale and within my budget during the busy school holiday period. London Heathrow to Mumbai was delayed by 40 minutes but we reached Mumbai on time, food and drinks were served on time and were sumptuous. The seats had the most leg room compared to other carriers I have travelled with. The only problem I had to face was with the entertainment system which was not working but I had my laptop so I was not bored. I would consider Air India in future."
667,"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to Chicago via Delhi. My TV screen didn't work for the entire flight of 16 hours, not only mine entire 4 rows didn't work so I couldn't even change my seat. Service is bad, staff are rude and didn't respond to our complaints. Food, can't expect more from any airlines but same old. "
668,✅ Verified Review |  Check in and security check was very efficient. Staff were courteous and accommodated my request for a window seat politely. Plane was nicely maintained and FAs were attentive. Left on time and actually arrived few minutes early. Instructions or signage for connections were little bit confusing. Some of the passengers were routed through international transfer desk and other have to go around at Delhi airport.
669,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Mumbai.  The departure was delayed a bit due to a medical emergency on the inbound flight.  Crew started drinks service accompanied by a pack of peanuts. Drinks included apple, orange juice, whiskey, water. As I opted for the veg option, the lunch consisted of paneer kofta with rice and vegetables with a bun, salad and kheer for dessert. The meal was quite tasty and filling which was good. Afterwards, the IFE kept me occupied for most part of the flight. The IFE was not expansive but for a 9 hour journey managed to keep me occupied. The crew dimmed the windows after lunch to make passengers get some sleep. Before landing, supper was provided which consisted of a samosa, veg cutlet and panner tikka with a bun, fruits and gulab jamun for dessert. Arrival in Mumbai was delayed by 35 mins. The seats were quite comfortable, the crew were a bit stiff but provided regular drinks. However, at the end of the flight the cabin area was a complete mess with blankets and debris all over the floor. Would travel with them again on this sector."
670,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Bangkok return. The thing that stands out is the inconsistency in overall rating. That was exactly my experience - inconsistent. Not sure what to expect. DEL-BKK: Boeing 787, ample leg space, acceptable IFE, acceptable inflight service, helping and offering of drinks. Flight stewards did their job, all boxes ticked, nothing to complain-nothing to write home about. All these compared to the price I paid- good value for money BKK-DEL: Morning flight, same equipment, same IFE. But the only variable factor, in flight service, fell like nine pins. Type of meal I prefer finished by the time it came to me, since this is a morning flight, they were not serving drinks (never seen that before). When requested, got snubbed down badly by flight steward. Overall verdict: good for price sensitive travelers but don't expect much from service standpoint. Barring that, expect tick in most of the boxes."
671,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to London. I was happy with the experience on this flight. For breakfast I opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea.  The inflight entertainment was ample. I managed to get a few hours of sleep as well. The seats are comfortable enough. The crew were very polite and professional and provided regular drinks. Before landing lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course of vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would fly again with Air India and recommend this."
672,"✅ Verified Review |  I had travelled on the early morning flight from Mumbai to London on this Air India flight and was pleasantly happy with the experience on this flight. The flight departed on time and the load on this sector was quite a bit. After takeoff, the breakfast service commenced and as I had opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea. The breakfast was very tasty and sumptuous. The inflight entertainment was ample for this 9 hour journey and had sufficient programs to keep one occupied. I also managed to get a few hours of sleep aswell in economy class. The seats are comfortable enough and there is ample legroom. Quite possibly the best legroom for intercontinental flights in economy. The crew were very polite and carried out their tasks with utmost professionalism and provided regular drinks of water/juice to the passengers. Before landing the crew distributed immigration cards and also lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course which consisted of mixed vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent and we arrived also perfectly on time which was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would definitely fly again with Air India and recommend this."
673,"✅ Verified Review |  Riyadh to Delhi. It was the worst experience, though it has never been excellent. The aircraft didn't have a TV screen. It didn't have the pillows. The food was disaster, no pickles, no salad, no bun and butter, no mouth freshener, no wet tissues. Looked as we are on a budget flight."
674,"✅ Verified Review |  New Delhi to Hong Kong. I am disgusted and appalled at the lack of basic customer service shown by the Delhi airport Air India staff.  I have travelled Air India many times and taken advantage of their ‘airport upgrade’ service whereby once can move from economy to business for a relatively reasonable fee. However, this trip I received a mail in advance saying I could arrange over the phone to increase certainty of a seat within 24hrs. I thought fantastic – but in hindsight I wish I had never received the mail. After the first 20 mins phone call they advised I was too early and so arranged call back. This was executed, but done two hours later and so again not within the 24hrs so another wasted 20mins. I called back the next day to arrange and 20mins later was advised it was completed and would see new ticket issued. It didn’t come but my CR card notified of a transaction and so I assumed all good. I got to airport ready to have an easy journey with no fuss. First off I was advised no upgrade been done, no record. I showed CR Card and asked them to sort out whereby everyone walked away and left me for 10mins until I insisted in speaking to the most senior person. The Duty Manager has not a single ounce of customer service in his body! No acknowledgement, no sorry no apology. After another 15-20mins they tell me the transaction was cancelled and refunded as they forgot to charge the GST. And so I should pay again! At this stage again no apologies or acceptance that this was their problem not mine. Then I had to go to another area and pay again with no service and no priority.  My advice to all unfortunately is to avoid this airline if you can"
675,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Kochi to London Heathrow via Delhi. I have to admit Air India exceeded my expectations, both sectors was on time and flown on B787 dreamliner which was clean and legroom was better than QR and EK. Food was good and IFE was acceptable. The only downside I felt was the attitude of some of the flight attendants, there was no smile and looked as if they were not interested in the job. Couple of times the food cart hit my seat hard from behind and there was not even a reaction let alone an apology. Overall I enjoyed the flight and would recommend Air India."
676,"✅ Verified Review | I would not recommend Air India if you are travelling with kids. I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read). I guess they don't care too much about custom."
677,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Delhi return. Worst airline I have ever travelled on. Food was disgusting on the way back from India. Air hostesses were rude with attitude problems. They were hardly ever seen on the flight, when I went to the loo I saw one of them perched on a stool reading a magazine. When the plane was landing they didn't check all the overhead lockers were shut and neither did they check everyone was wearing their belts. Children were running up and down the aisles and people were getting their luggage out of the lockers as the plane landed. It was the flight from hell."
678,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Cochin via Delhi. Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays.  In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option. I would rather pay an extra few quid to avoid the dirty aircrafts, crew and having to transit in Indian Airports."
679,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Newark return. I was very nicely surprised, there is much more room on Air India Boeing 787 than you get on BA, who really pack you into the Business Class section. There is more room between seats and the width of the seat is wider. Food is okay, booze plentiful and wide choice. No Noise Reducing headphones, which is normal in Business Class. They do not have their own Airport lounge but at Heathrow share the Lufthansa lounge which is nice. In Newark they share the Virgin lounge and the Virgin staff treated us very badly, not allowing us food, and denying any waitress service for drink. Rude ground crew at both Heathrow and Newark."
680,"✅ Verified Review | I choose Air India because of its flying timing and 2 check-in bags on this route from Paris to Delhi. Check-in at CDG was smooth and quick (web check-in). The Boeing 787 is a modern aircraft but the interior of this flight looked dull, although seat comfort and legroom were good. The dinner was average but the breakfast should be improved, overall a good flight considering price and timing, I will continue to use Air India on this route for hassle free travel."
681,✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Mumbai. Excellent crew. I was traveling with 2 kids. The air host and hostess were extremely nice. I had low blood pressure and they treated me like family and made me and my kids comfortable.
682,"✅ Verified Review |  Vadodara to Delhi. Received a SMS from Air India about delay of 40 mins and ultimately flight departed with a delay of 1.5 hrs. Boarding gates no staff until Boarding started. Seating was on 1 D, Seat comfort was good, meal served with Rice and Dal along with a Bun and Paneer curry. A bad choice of combinations. With a further delay of 20 Min Finally landed with a overall delay of 1hr 50 mins."
683,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Delhi. I cannot believe Air India is still a real airline. Starting from the attitude of the cabin crew to the service, it was all downhill. Non vegetarian food finished before reaching our seat. We opted for vegetarian instead but apparently that was over too. Finally settled with one extra croissant. The cabin crew looked unhappy. I'm sure they have their issues with the airline but it should not snowball onto the customers."
684,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangalore to Tokyo via Delhi. Horrible experience, and Air India always runs late. I won't ever fly this airline again. For the second time in 3 months the connecting flight was late and I missed the flight to Tokyo. Equipment OK, cabin crew not up to global business class standards. Mind boggling."
685,"✅ Verified Review |  Guwahati to Delhi with Air India. The flight was delayed by 15 minutes, and the flight was completely full. Light refreshments were served during the course of the flight which were adequate and well prepared. Leg room was excellent. Despite the delayed start, the flight landed on time at Delhi. Overall a good value for money."
686,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Varanasi. The flight was delayed by winter fog by an hour and a half. The aircraft was very old. The cabin crew was polite and hospitable, but the food (morning snacks) was sub-standard.  Not a pleasant and comfortable flight experience."
687,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Air India from Delhi to Guwahati. Flight took off on time and landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Delicious food coupled with excellent service by the cabin crew made the journey even more relaxing. The leg room is excellent, the only thing lacking was the absence of IFE on this flight."
688,"✅ Verified Review |  Super convenient 3 pm departure from Delhi. Only direct flight from Delhi to Madrid. Excellent legroom in Economy class - more than any other long-haul airline I have been on. Adequate film choices in English. Decent meal, wholesome snack - more substantive than ANA which I flew to Tokyo from Delhi last month. Absolutely nothing wrong in traveling this airline. Asked for a Gin and tonic, got two without asking. Just don't understand why people criticize this airline so much. It's my preferred choice in Economy when possible."
689,"✅ Verified Review |  Took early morning flight last week from Mumbai to Kolkata with Air India. Departure was delayed by about 35 minutes, which was informed previous night itself so not an issue. Flight departed on revised time. Was served tasty, sumptuous breakfast during the flight. Overall an uneventful flight. Would surely fly them again."
690,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Delhi on Air India. I had taken this afternoon flight on an Airbus A321 after checking in online prior to the flight. Had dropped off my baggage at the designated drop off point and proceeded towards the boarding gate. The flight crew on this flight were quite polite and professional. Even though the departure time was 1pm, we had left around 1.15 or so. After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served. This flight had an occupancy of around 85% and we reached our destination 10 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all, it was an excellent flight and I would fly with them again."
691,"✅ Verified Review |  Birmingham to Bangalore via Delhi. It was first time I have traveled on Air India on international sector. Check was smooth, Boarding as usual. Pushed back on time and arrived Delhi on time. Food on Birmingham to Delhi was good. In process of hot drink serving the way they serve hot drink without trolley is scary, they will pour hot liquid into passenger cup using a small tray at passenger space expense. I had argument on this serving methodology when we were landing into Delhi. Found pillow provided was stained. Apart from above issue the rest was good.."
692,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew on Air India from New Delhi to Lucknow. I was transferring from Lufthansa to Air India, so checked-in my bag at the designated counter for connecting passengers. When I presented my Air India boarding pass and check-in bag (which was already tagged from L.A. to Lucknow), they told me that I would have to go upstairs to the main check-in area. I insisted that they process me at the designated counter for connecting passengers, or else it beats the purpose for having one in the first place! Overall, I wasn't impressed with the ground staff's professionalism. The on-board experience was okay. I wished the Flight Attendant ""Good Morning"" while entering the aircraft, she responded ""Namaskar"". It was a short 1 hour flight with express snack service. There was no IFE or WiFi on-board. If you are travelling with a baby or sitting in an exit row, the flight attendant will ask you if you prefer instructions in English or Hindi."
693,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Delhi. Yet again very disappointed. Again a dirty plane, dirty roof, vents, table, entertainment control and window surround. And although I had put my seat selection in my reservation I was put further down the plane in a middle seat. The reason for choosing seat 19D in my booking was to sit beside my colleague. We were both moved. Why bother asking us to select seats if you're going to stick us anywhere you like, even as a Star Alliance frequent flyer program. I flew with Air India in 2015 from the London to Mumbai and have chosen to avoid that on my last 5 visits with the exception of a couple of domestic flights and Air India have not failed to disappoint. Not good enough Air India. I'm a frequent flyer, taking long haul flights about 30 times a year plus domestic connections and Air India is really low grade."
694,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Delhi to Birmingham. We were happy with the service we received. The flight was punctual, legroom was good (we are all tall so this has always been important). Staff were pleasant and helpful and the baggage arrived quickly. Proud to fly Air India."
695,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Air India from New Delhi to Chicago. Business Class toilet was very dirty. Tissue paper and other garbage on the floor, no one bothered to clean it. After two hours, I returned and the toilet was in the same condition. This is simply unacceptable. Business Class toilet ran out of tissue and no one bothered to refill it. It was empty throughout the flight. Again this is simply outrageous. My entertainment system did not work at first. I reported this to one of the attendants and he restarted and it seemed to work. But in the end, the Flight Map was still broken. There were no meal menu given to us during this trip. The meals were verbally communicated to us. I paid $US2,000 only to be told what is in my meals. I had two small meals during this flight and each time I completed my meal the tray was not picked up in a timely fashion. I think I must have waited 25 minutes after I finished my meal, for the tray to be picked up. The flight attendants did not walk down the aisle as often as I think they should. Service was not a top priority for this set of crew. Meals were warm although I've had better economy international food than Air India's business class. I can assure you that my next trip to India will not be with Air India."
696,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Mumbai. The check in process was quite smooth and as I had already checked in to the flight via the mobile app, all that was left was to print the boarding passes and baggage tags and deposit baggage. The departure time of the flight was 13:15 however the flight departed after a delay of 45 mins. The inflight service was top notch. After an hour or so, flight attendants served drinks (eg. orange juice, water, whiskey) and peanuts. I opted for the non veg option for lunch which was lamb curry with rice along with salad, a bun and kheer for dessert. The food was excellent. The IFE entertainment had a good collection of movies (Hollywood/ Bollywood) and TV shows. Before landing, a second hot meal service where for non veg, malai chicken along with veg hara bhara kebab and pattice was given along with a bun, fruits and a gulab jamun for dessert. We arrived at Mumbai at around 3am and proceeded to collect baggage without any problems. All in all, a good solid flight with nice friendly crew, good cabin atmosphere, ambience, good IFE content, good food to eat. "
697,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to London on Boeing 787. The legroom is quite spacious and flight attendants were polite and professional. For breakfast I opted for the non-veg option which was omlette with chicken sausage and potatoes, croissant, fruit salad, bun and tea. The breakfast was very tasty. Upon waking up, a second round of food and drinks service started and watched a Hollywood movie. The non veg option contained chicken and rajma with rice, salad and gulab jamun. Before arrival, immigration forms were handed out. The flight attendants went about their tasks efficiently even though they may have been stiff on certain occasions. I would recommend this airline on this sector. "
698,"✅ Verified Review |  I am very disappointed with the airlines as i booked my ticket from Newark to Mumbai with a connection flight from Mumbai. I am already on my way to airport, i was informed that the flight got cancelled due to technical issues and should postpone my visit to next day. It was important for me to fly on the same day and hence asked them to make necessary arrangements. I was routed to NY airport and was told that I will be issued a new itinerary from NY to DEL. Once reached the NY airport, was asked to find a connection flight on my own from DEL. I had to put up an hour's argument to prove my point that its a last minute cancellation and would be difficult for me to rebook a flight from Delhi and it being after 7PM will be even more difficult to find any local flights. Now, I am not sure if i can take the risk of flying back in Air India as the last minute cancellations seems to be pretty common for them and asked them to cancel the return trip and process the refund. its been 7 days since i made multiple calls and haven't heard from them yet. I feel really bad to say that such a big carrier offering worldwide services has such poor standards."
699,✅ Verified Review |  Kolkata to Delhi. Good experience at Kolkata airport with the ground staff. I had a flight at 10 am but couldn't reach airport on time due to some emergency. The staff understood my situation and gave me the boarding pass even after I was late by 15 mins from the expected show up time i.e. 9am. A big thumbs up to the staff.
700,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Newark. Got to the gate 1 hour and 30 min before takeoff instead of going to all the star alliance lounges. Mistake, you can probably arrive 45 min before takeoff despite what you're boarding pass says. Boarded the plane and we sat there with the In-Flight Entertainment not working for an hour and a half. We had to remind the flight attendant to turn it on. The screen though is massive, and there is a wide variety of movies in HD in English and Indian. This is probably because of their new 787 Dreamliner which is very nice. The seats recline a lot and the windows are all tinted blue the whole flight so the plane isn't to bright. We got served a Indian lamb or chicken dish. Very authentic Indian food along with very nice Indian flight attendants. IFE stayed on the whole flight and they server a breakfast of chicken and falafel which was very good. Landed very smoothly with 40 mph cross winds. Impressive food, service, and comfort from Air India."
701,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Air India from Bhubaneswar to New Delhi. The only bad thing was the delayed flight. All the rest was excellent. Seats were good, food and staff service was good. Clean Lounge. Enough food was given. I requested hot water and that was fulfilled by staff."
702,"✅ Verified Review |  Bhopal to New Delhi. A pleasant experience flying Air India. I wanted to appreciate the ground staff at Bhopal airport including the Security who helped us a great deal to arrange boarding the aircraft. We reached airport just 30 min before scheduled departure and the check-in was closed. After requests, since we as a family had to take onward flight from delhi, the ground staff went out of the way to help us with quick check in, luggage check-in and everything else till the time we boarded the aircraft. The aircraft was on-time, with spacious leg room, good seats, food was excellent and courteous staff. 
"
703,"✅ Verified Review |  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights. My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly. I find it difficult to believe that Air India truly wants its employees to treat passengers especially those who have paid a premium to fly in business class to be treated so poorly."
704,"✅ Verified Review |  Goa to London via Mumbai. We flew air India on the 12/13th February 2017 initially from Goa to Mumbai. The flight was delayed to Mumbai by 30 minutes, then we were told the flight would be 1 hour delayed, in the end the flight was delayed by over 3 hours resulting in our connecting flight on Jet Airways being missed back to the UK. The whole experience was handled very poorly by the ground staff at Goa, there were no announcements regarding the reason why or any updates. After 2 hours, more passengers started to arrive for the later flight so it was obvious that the two flights were being combined. On arrival and at check in, we were handed boarding passes with a capital D printed on the boarding pass, indicating delayed but the new arrivals were issued regular boarding passes. As it turned out, we departed Goa at 01.30 on the 12th February, we knew by this stage that the connecting flight was not possible. On our arrival at Mumbai we were left to our own devices with Air India totally washing their hands of our situation. The ground staff were aggressive, dismissive, rude and generally not getting involved. At one point we were sent to the customer information desk in the airport, it was not an Air India information desk, just a general desk for airport services. Jet Airways would have nothing to do with us either, blaming the other airline, (this will be another review). We ended up buying 2 new tickets on Air India to Birmingham via Delhi, (it was the only flight out that morning,) would you believe it but this flight was delayed by 2.5hrs so we missed our connecting flight once again. We were offered the next flight out to London Heathrow, we had boarding passes issued, collected our luggage, checked in again and rushed to the departure gate, managed to get on the plane and would you believe: we were delayed by another 2 hours. It appears this is a very common everyday issue for this airline. On my return to the UK, I was informed by other travellers that the exact same delay occurred on the Friday night. The flight was not the best, an old Boeing 777, dirty interior, absolutely filthy toilets that smelled terrible. The inflight entertainment system on our seats stopped working after 40 minutes, this happened on 2 occasions so we were not able to watch anything in full, not even the shorter programs. My only praise for this whole experience were the cabin crew on this leg from Delhi to Heathrow, they were jolly, chatty and polite. Since my return, I have tried to contact Air India numerous times for a delayed flight certificate, but with no reply. I'm not sure if they have any customer support in the UK but if they do, they dont want to be found. I was told to travel to Heathrow to Air India ticket office to collect the certificate. 500 miles round trip from my home, I dont think that will happen. So my overall view of Air India is not a good one, I personally would not fly them again unless there were no other carrier's flying to that particular airport. One piece of advice, if your flying to join another flight in Mumbai please give yourself ample time at least 6 hours if not more just in case of delays."
705,"✅ Verified Review |  
We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787."
706,"✅ Verified Review |  I have received a particularly poor experience from Air India and would like to pass this feedback onto other travellers as I don't want anyone else to suffer as I have done. Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

707,"✅ Verified Review |  Kathmandu to Heathrow via Delhi. It was my first flight with Air India. It was good connection flight for me so wanted to try Air India. I am not fussy passenger. It was fine when I flew to Kathmandu but way back had a horrible experience. The crew members have very bad attitude and are very rude. When first snacks peneuts and soft drink was served, I requested the cabin crew that I would like to have cup of tea insead of soft drink please and she said that I have to wait till after dinner for tea.  I seated to wait after dinner. I had transit flight got headache. I went to washroom and ask a gentleman if possible to have cup of tea please, he said "" of course"". The lady who refused me before was came to me and asked why I am asking him tea as she just told me to wait after dinner. I told her that sorry but I am allowed to have tea. This is a small incident. Dinner was served. It was a different lady walking through by my seat. I stopped her and request her may I please have cup of water, she was very angry. I thought she did not hear me properly, I asked her a bit louder again. She started arguing with me why I am shouting at her. I said I am not shouting you I thought you did not hear me. I would like to have cup of water for my tablets please. She never came back. Very bad service.  My TV remote control did not work and I did not bother to request to change the seat, but refusing for a cup of water is impossible. I won't fly with Air India again. It was a horrible experience."
708,"❎ Unverified |  Flew Air India direct from New York to Delhi round trip. Flight departed late both times. Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either."
709,"✅ Verified Review |  Colombo to Moscow via Delhi. What a simply awful carrier, my niece flew to Sri Lanka for 6 months returning home to Moscow for Christmas. All four flights times and dates were changed. Even after calling their help desk and getting the flights changed to what was needed, they were changed again. Now to cap it all her flights back in May have also been changed, leaving Colombo Fri 19th May, arriving Delhi at 1205, so far so good? She then has to overnight in Delhi for 31 hours, leaving Delhi on Sat 20th May at 1910. When I called their help line to ask why she could not have a seat on the 1910hrs flight out on the 19th, I was immediately passed on to someone else, who after putting me on hold for over 10 minutes told me they could do nothing about it and to call Colombo. I have never spoken to more unhelpful people who clearly could not care less that a young woman will be all alone in Delhi and not knowing where to get a good hotel etc. Disgraceful does not even begin to cover their attitude. I would not recommend this airline or its people to anyone."
710,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Birmingham to Delhi with Air India. Decent plane but poorly organised check in, left one hour late and landed late because of fog they said, missed our connecting flight to Varanasi and they were no help at all. Inflight entertainment poor, grumpy staff except a couple, didn't monitor the cabin, everything was an effort. One screen didn't work at all on the return and earphone plug on way out was damaged. Never had one of their flights that took off on time. Would never use them again even on a direct flight.

711,"✅ Verified Review |  Worst experience ever with Air India! I traveled alone with my 9 month old son from Frankfurt to Delhi and onto Sydney! It's a very long and exhausting flight and I think everybody knows with a baby it's even harder! The first problems started when they weren't be able to print the boarding pass for my son. They kept me 2 hours in front of the check-in that I couldn't care properly for my son. Just waiting. Without toilet, food or anything! After this 2 hours they gave me just the boarding pass until Delhi and I had to run carrying my son and all the luggage to the boarding as this had started already. Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover. And again they kept us 3 hours in front of the security check because of the boarding pass. No toilets, no food again - just hard chairs to wait on. I was really desperate as my son was just crying. They didn't care. I got more and more stressed. At the end they wrote a manual boarding pass and I had to run again to the boarding to get my 12 hours flight. Terrible! "
712,"✅ Verified Review | This flight from Bodhgaya to Delhi was the latest of about 20 domestic flights sectors completed with Air India over the last 3 - 4 years. The level of service has remained consistent in all areas, with some aspects of service stronger than others. This flight was originally due to depart Bodhgaya at 14.35h arriving in Delhi at 16.25h. An initial delay to a revised 16.00h departure was notified by e-mail several hours in advance. Check-in queue management at Bodhgaya airport was poor but agent service was good once you eventually got to the check-in desk. After further delay at Bodhgaya airport the flight eventually departed shortly after 18.00h and arrived at Delhi at about 20.00h. Not a single delay announcement was made at Bodhgaya airport and the information board simply showed the word 'delay' next to the flight number. We had no idea how long the delay would be until we saw our aircraft land. Except for an expensive coffee kiosk there were no customer facilities while waiting. The flight itself was straightforward and typical of one on Air India's short-haul A320 fleet with friendly, patient, efficient cabin crew and reasonably comfortable seating in a slightly grubby cabin. A simple in-flight snack was served. No announcements from the captain except an abrupt order for cabin crew to take their seats for take off and again for landing. Cabin crew announcements included a sincere apology for the delay. Arrived at Delhi's Terminal 3 where we exited through the international arrivals section because our flight had originated in Yangon, Burma, before picking up passengers in Bodhgaya. This meant that the domestic passengers among us had to join a long slow-moving queue to clear, bizarrely, passport control, where just two desks were dedicated to clearing many domestic passengers, presumably from several flights. It took more than an hour just to get as far as the baggage hall. The lesson is to remember to leave plenty of time if you take a domestic flight with Air India before connecting to an international flight."
713,"✅ Verified Review |  I was pleasantly surprised with my trip with Air India from Mumbai to Goa. It was such a comfortable journey. I have flown previously on International sectors with AI, but, never experienced such comfort. To start off, the crew were polite to passengers. However, they could have toned down their laughter and language when in the Galley. Meal was reasonable for a short domestic flight. IFE was non-existent as the screens were covered with a headrest cover. Overall, I really liked this flight because they depart from Terminal 2 at Mumbai and because I noticed a positive change in the crew's approach towards passengers. I would not hesitate to try them again on the narrow body planes for domestic flights."
714,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vadodara via Delhi. I last traveled in Air India in January 2014 and the service was horrible. This time service was really good. Staff was happy to help, were very polite and they were young and fresh. Good food and good service. I was very surprised by all this and there is a massive difference in the service and for better.

715,"✅ Verified Review |  I traveled Milan to Chennai via Delhi. Not much to complain except the total lack of communication for baggage picking and delay announcements: in Milan I was told (several times) that my luggage would have been sent directly to Chennai, but I had to collect it in Delhi and checking it in again before departing to Chennai. Moreover, the flight to Chennai was heavily delayed and we had no info from Air India while waiting for it. Seat was comfortable enough, I had better experience but there was room enough for my legs (I'm 1.83m tall). Food was actually very good: I opted for the vegetarian meal and it was tasty and abundant. InFlight entertainment could be better: plenty of Indian movies and old international ones but few choices for the new international movies. That said, since the ticket was quite cheap Air India is a good value for money option."
716,✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Frankfurt via Delhi. The flight from Mumbai to Delhi got cancelled and I was put aboard a Mumbai to Shanghai flight which stopped in Delhi. This flight had delay. The staff of this flight was very courteous and helpful. The flight was clean and the infotainment system performed problem free. The next flight from Delhi to Frankfurt the cabin crew was very helpful and courteous. The seats were comfortable. They served very good Indian food . At the end of the cabin was a place where drinks and juices along with peanuts were kept ready for the passengers. The luggage allowance of Air India is also generous.  In all a very good service. Negatives - the Air India magazine was not in good shape and the ground crew of Air India are not exactly up to the mark...
717,✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to Chicago via New Delhi. Planned early and selected required seats during purchase. I travel every year and I usually select seats at the time of purchase. I never had different seats than what I usually select initially. This time Air India changed my seats and gave horrible explanation when I requested for change of seats. I don't recommend this carrier due to this type of service.
718,✅ Verified Review |  Kathmandu to Delhi. Good flight that departed and landed on time. Very high security with Air India (only) also screening all passengers on the tarmac again before they board the plane with intensive hand luggage search. Fairly old plane but not full and comfortable seating and legroom. Nice hot snack provided on short flight. Disappointed that checkin staff were unable to provide boarding pass for my connecting flight despite it being on one ticket (and hold baggage sent all the way through to London). Quick disembarkation at Delhi despite needing to use bus.
719,"✅ Verified Review |  Ahmedabad to Delhi. I was really impressed by Air India on this trip. I had to change my initial flight and the call centre was excellent - you get through to them immediately and they promptly complied with my request. Check in staff were very helpful. Flight departed and arrived on time. Cabin was in good condition. On a 1hour and 15 minute flight, we were served a delicious dinner. This is one area where Air India really score on internal flights - they serve excellent hot meals even on short-haul flights. Crew was very efficient and friendly with genuine smiles to boot. Baggage service was excellent too. All in all an excellent flight."
720,✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to London. An agreeable flight in general. Departure was 20 mins late but crew provided an apology and we arrived on time. The aircraft looked pretty new and the cabin appearance was good. Seats were really comfortable and legroom/recline are excellent. I normally struggle to sleep on planes but managed to get 4 hours sleep. Cabin crew did their job - nothing to write home about as such. This flight departs at 2.30 am so they serve refreshments after take off and breakfast before landing. There is no drinks service. Baggage arrived promptly. Overall a decent flying experience.
721,"✅ Verified Review |  This was only the second time to fly Air India, from London to Delhi and returning, in December 2016. A very mixed review. Outward flight on an old plane, quite tatty looking, but a nice big drink of whiskey served and delicious Indian meal. Inbound flight on Dreamliner, leaving 2.15 a.m. Good leg room and excellent screen. Toilets dirty and ran out of paper which was not replaced. No drinks offered but again, food was really tasty. But really, the movie and music selection is not good enough. Is this cost-cutting, lack of imagination, or what? Service on both flights was quite basic and no extras offered. But adequate."
722,"Newark to Goa via Mumbai with Air India. Due to a snow storm my flight was cancelled - however, even 2 hours prior to the flight the customer service staff insisted that the flight was scheduled. I decided to call up the airport and they had to inform me that all flights were cancelled. The refund took 8 months to get back. On my return journey, the Goa Mumbai flight was delayed by 2 hours, and despite the fact that I had a connecting flight, I was told that the flight from Mumbai to Newark was delayed as well and would be able to catch it. 3 hours later arriving in Mumbai, I was met by 2 of their staff and informed that the flight had taken off. I had to wait 14 hours in the airport for them to put me on another flight."
723,Mumbai to Newark. Flew on Air India twice last month and it was disastrous both ways. Multiple restrooms were malfunctioned on both flights. The food was mostly unappealing. The flight was delayed both times. Worst part was some of my bags were missing at baggage claim which was the case for most returning passengers. One of the bags came in the mail but we waited one week for the other two and ultimately had to go to Newark airport to retrieve the bags as the airline employees had left the bags with no feeling of accountability and were not apologetic at all. I have been flying with Air India for 15+.years but never again.

Flew Air India from Newark to Mumbai via London. The seats were comfortable and they did serve food quite often on both flights. Food was nothing special. Restrooms were clean and tidy. Cabin crew on the first flight from EWR to LHR were not so friendly and the air hostess did not even know where the same flight was going from LHR. On the second flight from LHR to BOM they were much more friendly and served food and beverages very well. Entertainment was good. Mix of Hollywood and bollywood movies and shows. Many good Indian regional movies."
725,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Delhi. Overall the flying experience was acceptable. The check-in was smooth and boarding well organised. Onboard the aircraft looked tired. Flight landed 20 mins early. The best part of the flight was possibly the seat leg room and pitch which were generous for economy class and make a huge difference on a long haul flight. IFE is poor particularly if you are not Indian. I was shocked that the music channels were exclusively Indian - I mean not a single English channel. Drinks service - choice of beverages was poor. Dinner main course was one of the tastiest airline food I've had but portions were tiny. Starter and dessert poor. Breakfast was a joke - a small bowl of fruit and 2 cheap mini croissants. Tea was great. If you do not like curry, make sure to book a continental meal (Air India offer western meal as a special meal that can be pre-booked). Cabin crew were courteous and did a good job. A passenger complained of breathlessness and I saw crew provide timely attention. A flight attendant serving me had a genuine smile, helping out an elderly couple who seemed to be a bit frazzled by the flying experience. "
726,"✅ Verified Review | Flew from Bangkok to Mumbai with Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The check-in was not that comfortable and although the flight was delayed by an hour it didn't create any issues. The cabin crew do not have a welcoming nature and also have poor language skills. The washrooms were smelly. The seats had a very hard cushioning which made it very uncomfortable. The food tasted good and the legroom was quite comfortable. Although, overall very disappointed with the flag carrier of India."
727,"✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Paris CDG via Delhi with Air India. Having read the other reviews online, which are less than flattering, I booked with hesitation. Overall, the experience wasn't nearly as horrifying as I'd expected. The flight was comfortable, the seat and legroom was great (and I'm over 6 feet tall); Economy class has an amazing seat pitch on the Air India Dreamliner. Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap. As long as you bring some snacks, a book or iPad, and a calm temperament, you'll survive at the very least."
728,"We had a so so flight from Sydney to Delhi on 2 November. We found the staff cold, unfriendly and never smiled once, just barely functional. Our return flight 17 November, Delhi to Sydney was one of the poorest we have encountered in many years of travelling around the world. Firstly, we boarded the flight at 1305 in preparation for a 1345 departure. 1 hour later, no movement, the captain announced there was a problem with the fuel loaded which did not talley with the fuel gauge. A further 2 hours later he announced the Boeing engineer had arrived and they could see the problem being solved within 30 minutes. Nothing further for another 2 hours, ie 5 hours in total sitting on the Tarmac. No apology for the delay as the plane finally began taxiing and no communication from the flight deck at all throughout the 11.5 flight. The crew were marginally better than the original flight but appear to be very poorly trained, the food was awful and the entertainment poor. Never again Air India."
729,"Did a multicity itinerary with Air India (CCU-FCO, CDG-DEL) and experience was mixed. Call Centre: My interaction with the call centre was actually very good. We had to reschedule our flight from Kolkata to Delhi and it was done for free by calling the call centre. The call centre staff were extremely helpful and efficient. The process was quick and hassle free. Airport Staff are quite friendly. Check in process was smooth enough. Ground staff at Delhi airport were quite helpful in aiding the international transfer. The aircraft itself has to improve. There were some shabby patchworks (especially seat upholstry and remote of the entertainment system). The international flight was a wee bit better than the domestic flight, though not great. Cabin Crew were friendly, though a bit cold in their demeanour. Their response time can improve. However the worst experience of this entire trip was on our flight from Paris to Delhi, there seemed to be a shortage of water on board. The crew served half filled glasses everytime a passenger asked for water. This was completely unacceptable. The food was above average. Nothing to write home about. All our flights actually ran on time. Overall the experience was above average."
730,"✅ Verified Review |  The Air India A319 from Lucknow to Mumbai look to be very old and some of the features were not working properly. The service buttons above the emergency seats were not working, the cabin crew wasn't active. I pushed the service button in order to get a feedback form but it wasn't functional. Food for all passengers is ok, but if the plane is not good enough. Air India is the oldest airline of India, that doesn't mean that their planes should also be old. "
731,✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Mumbai via Delhi. Would not fly Air India again. They lost all 3 of our bags and never offered us even a toothbrush to help us until it was found. Because we had no checked in baggage in which to stow my unopened duty free they took it from us. and although I emailed the airline they did not reply and it was never returned. Food was very ordinary especially for western travelers and stewardesses refused to help my grand daughter retrieve her overhead baggage which was at the back of the locker and she could not reach. A very unpleasant trip.
732,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Delhi. I travel business class to India 6 to 8 times and started flying Air India from last year. I am now being harassed by the airline to verify my identity online, but the website link provided by AI does not allow me to do so and phone calls are no help. The meagre flying return air miles are suspended until the verification takes place. I tried to complain, but after filling in the extraordinarily long list of requirements on the website complaint form the submit button would not function. Utterly diabolical. Onboard service and food are abysmal and ground staff pretty awful too, without any real courtesy towards business class passengers spending thousands of pounds (on one flight they tried to downgrade me to economy class without explanation and only relented when I began to phone a Indian Union Cabinet Minister friend). There is no email to which one can write and the CMD is apparently completely unavailable.  I am travelling BA tomorrow, having abandoned Air India which I flew out of a misguided desire to help India's national airline. "
733,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Ahmedabad return. I had not used Air India for nearly 8 years because of poor service previously but we booked this flight because it was a direct flight, and both legs of our journey could not have been better. The flight was perfect, the condition of the plane was excellent and the technology on board worked, the plane left on time and we arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin staff were brilliant and food was great. Even when I wanted to change my return flight date the telephone staff in India were very professional and really helpful. "
734,✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Lucknow with Air India - first time on domestic sectors and it was a wonderful experience. I have to say after trying European airlines and US carriers Air India is the best if comparing domestic travel. On this short flight we were given 2 sandwiches and cake and tea or coffee which was amazing given it was all complimentry on a 50 minute flight. Would definitely reccomend Air India.
735,✅ Verified Review | Flew Air India frm Bhubaneswar to Varanasi and it was a wonderful flight. Crew were nice and took good care of passengers. Aircraft interiors were clean and well maintained. The flight was on time and it was surprising to see the change in the overall Air India experience.
736,✅ Verified Review | This was my another great experience flying with Air India on Varanasi to Bhubaneswar route. The flight was very comfortable with cushioned seats covered in elegant red and golden colours. The cabin crew was friendly and the flight was on time. The best part of the flight was as usual the meals. Air India definitely serves the best indian meals in the skies. Overall a good expereince and would definately recommend. The Star Alliance membership definitely gives it a good hand to be tried to earn points and their international and regional connectivity.
737,"One of the worst airlines I have flown. I was flying business class from Shanghai-Pudong to Bangalore seated in 1A. There is no concept of business class priority boarding (at least for this sector) and the prices was a mess. The food was not very good, and was extremely oily. When I converted my seat to a bed, there was a big hole in the back. The cabin crew however were nice and friendly and this was the only positive thing in the entire journey. Having flown with several other carriers such as Singapore, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, ANA, Lufthansa, Korean Air, I guess my expectations were high."
738,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Delhi with Air India. I am a Singaporean and have travelled on many flights / airlines. As I visit India frequently, I started using Air India for all sectors. I love the service and food. In Biz class the seat can be flat so it is easier to have a good night's sleep. Crew are good and helpful. I am now planning to try their service from Singapore to Paris. A few months ago I was in Kochin for a funeral. On my return I was so tired, the ground staff at counter helped me right to the lounge. I did not use the inflight wifi so I cannot comment."
739,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bangkok via New Delhi. Check-in was seamless, take off was late but arrived almost on time. Staff were helpful on Heathrow to Delhi, though not that smiley. Delhi to Bangkok the staff were rather abrupt. Food was reasonable, though breakfast a bit sparse. Drinks offered twice throughout the first flight, though flight was overnight so that may have been why. Water was offered frequently though first half of flight then vanished (again, was overnight flight). Seats were basic, and no amenities kit offered. Blanket was warm, and cabin temp was generally good. Bathroom basic, floor got a bit wet as first flight progressed. Liked the hand cream in the bathroom. As for entertainment - a large selection of Indian fare, and a handful of up-to-date films mixed in with classics. I watched Me Before You and When Harry Met Sally. Unfortunately my headphones stopped working a few hours before landing. I encountered two sets of broken headphones on my connecting flight. Overall - better than expected. Flight was only 230GBP (connecting to Bangkok), so good value."
740,"✅ Verified Review |  Chandigarh to Vadodara via Delhi. Very happy with the Air India service, it was unexpected as I travelled first time with the Air India. Special attention provided by flight attendants as I was travelling with small baby. First time I herd anybody on flight demonstrating how to take care of baby during any emergency point, if any. Provided with seat with extra oxygen mask. Food served was hot. The flight attendants were good at their work. All together good experience. Hope same always, may be more better.
"
741,✅ Verified Review |  I tried going back to my home town Lucknow from Delhi on Air India. The crew was the rudest of all the airline crews. I asked for a cup of water and I never got my cup of extra water cause the bottle provided had just emptied. This was my first and last time flying with Air India. 
742,"Mumbai to Bangkok. This was an early morning flight, departing Mumbai at about 2AM. I did not expect a big meal or gourmet offerings, but I did expect a certain amount of quality. This was a relatively new plane, but everything seemed kind of worn and I am not sure why. Perhaps it is the colors they use, all tans and browns. The seat was fairly comfortable if not plush. Amenities were spare. There was a meal service, but it was poorly presented with the main dish in an aluminum plate. There was no explanation of the meal - just veg or non-veg - in Business Class?? There was no drink service, and the only thing offered prior to landing was a glass of water - not even coffee! The toilet, though appearing clean, smelled awful. I was pretty disappointed with the whole thing."
743,"✅ Verified Review |  Chennai to Singapore. I normally take SQ on this route for quick onward connections to my destinations but flew AI this time because it is the only daily daytime flight on this route. Going by the reviews in this forum I was a bit apprehensive but the flight turned out to be a very pleasant one. Departed 20 mins late, arrived 1 hour late. The aircraft was quite new (my first flight in a 787) the leg room which was about 33"". The generous legroom plus the fact the seat slides forward should make sleeping quite comfortable on long flights. AI offers a drinks cart service in economy, with miniature liquor bottles and quarter wine bottles. I asked for a beer and was offered a wine bottle as well to go with the lunch. Seconds were offered before the lunch was brought out. Indians rarely complain about food, which did not disappoint both by way of quantity and quality. Overall, a pleasant experience. "
744,"✅ Verified Review |  Pathetic service by Air India on 29th August from London to Delhi. I registered a child meal for my daughter 15 days in advance on Air India website. However, the child meal was not served consecutively in both inbound and return flight. To my surprise my daughter's name was not their in the food manifestation form shown to me by the staff despite booking full fare ticket for my 3 year old. The inflight entertainment was not working in entire flight after the first one hour. My wife was in business class and staff even refused to take my daughter to her mother's seat."
745,"✅ Verified Review |  The Air India flight started without delay from Chennai International Airport. The plane was clean and the cabin crew looked like they were not enjoying their job. The Plane was equipped with inflight entertainment system, but it was not working for the entire flight. The meal, which was provided without extra cost, was ok. The overall flight experience was within my expectations. For a domestic flight within India I would recommend this airline."
746,"Mumbai to Amritsar via New Delhi with Air India. To my surprise it was a pleasant trip as I had been told that it was not a good option to fly on Air India. The food quality and taste was great, I was greeted very well, the leg space is good as I am above 6ft. The biggest problem I normally have flying is with the leg space but there was ample room on this flight."
747,"A thoroughly mediocre experience and very disappointing from the National carrier. Air India could have done so much with the Dreamliner Executive class cabin which was old fashioned and dull. Service is professional but definitely without a smile on outward and return flights. Attendants look and appear miserable with awful uniforms. Food London Heathrow to Delhi acceptable but poor from Delhi to London Heathrow. IFE is limited and not as varied as competition. I had to book these flights at short notice and although competitively priced, I was left very disappointed with the product. The amenity kit is a joke. Service is dour and dull - do not expect a smile other than on boarding. Provision of menus, magazines, drinks etc is very old fashioned. Come on Air India - you should do better. I could go on but not sure it will make a difference. On a plus point, check-in was efficient both sides. The Dreamliner is smooth but you could do so much more with it. Despite late departure on both flights the time was made up. Luggage was out quickly. Lounges are extremely poor compared to competition."
748,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Kathmandu to Bengaluru via Delhi. Check in was quick even when they initially struggled to find my booking which was done via the Air India website. No, lounge access provided to biz class passengers or Star Alliance Gold members at Ktm airport which is weird. Flight departed on time arrived on schedule at Delhi but we were put on a bus to the terminal and it was raining heavily so some passengers had to wait for the second bus to arrive in the rain. The food served was acceptable for a 90 mins flight. Overall a below average experience."
749,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Air India A319 from Calcutta to Aizawl via Imphal, a short flight. No expectation, just wanted to reach Aizawl safe and sound. Food is okay, cabin crews were not friendly, one crew to a lady passenger ""why are you sitting here, this is for the airline engineer, move to the next seat"" - no please, no can you. I felt bad for the young girl. Other than Jet Airways, no other option between the two cities, so we are stuck with this."
750,"London Heathrow to Delhi with Air India (AI112). Since I flew in from Dublin I checked-in 4 hours before the flight when it opened at 1730 hrs. Check-in was a breeze and went to the Maharaja lounge. The receptionist was missing but the lady in-charge of catering was polite enough to invite me inside and offer service. The snacks were quite adequate with lovely Indian dishes like chicken-legs, shammi kebab etc. The bar had a few drinks like Bacardi, Black label but no single malt whiskey. Now, coming to the flight as such, the departure was before time and the onboard service was good. The hostess and flight purser serving our side were very good. Bar was well stocked and I got my single malt - Talisker. The food was very good, as usual. My neighbor was pleasantly surprised with the night-suit that was provided. Seat quality is good but nothing near the one in Air India's B787's. Touch down was announced as 10.10 am (as against the scheduled 10.40 am) and the flight reached Delhi air space by 9.45 and was made to circle for nearly an hour. Reached at 10.45. A very pelasant experience and at an optimum cost."
751,"Was really not sure what to expect on my first ever Air India flight flying from London Heathrow to Delhi, but very pleasantly surprised. The Dreamliner is a really good passenger experience, seats on Air India were wide and comfy, with large seat back tv, and superb views through the extra large windows. IFE was good, although lacked depth, especially on the audio side, where there was little for the western taste. Food was very good, I tried a Western and Indian vegetarian breakfast, both good in size and quality. Cabin crew were attentive and were happy to give me two cans of beer during drinks service. Departed on time and arrived on time, seat bet sign came on a few times but no turbulence materialized, so they were being cautious on this front, that's a good thing. Arrived on time into Delhi, airport was pretty empty, and e-visa / immigration took 5 minutes to pass through, bags through quickly and then into the humid and hot night air of Delhi. Enjoyed the experience, and the Dreamliner would not bother messing around travelling via the Middle East when you can have such good service on a non-stop flight."
752,"✅ Verified Review |  The domestic sector was nothing special, with the flight delayed on account of heavy rains. Very bumpy and short flight - rushed service. The international sector was excellent by economy standards. Pushback was early. Friendly and attentive crew, a clean aircraft, simple yet tasty food. Service started almost immediately after take off, but this was good since it was a mid-night flight and with the trays cleared reasonably quickly, one could sleep. I was quite impressed."
753,"✅ Verified Review | Mumbai to Coimbatore with Air India. The experience was surprisingly nice. There was enough legroom, it was nice to have lunch which included salad, main course and dessert. In addition, the cabin crew were were polite, and the flight was on-time. This was against the worst reviews I have heard about Air India."
754,"Air India flight from Mumbai to Bhubaneshwar was on time both ways, delayed by about 15 minutes on account of closure of main runway at Mumbai airport. Lunch was served on both sectors which was tasty and portions were adequate. Only grouse is that Air India uses gates which are at the far end of the terminal and so need a lot of walking to reach the gate."
755,"Hyderabad to Chicago via Delhi with Air India. In November 2015 I flew from Chicago to Delhi. That time my experience was pathetic. The staff were lousy, seat was uncomfortable, the table was cracked, 80% of the inflight entertainment system was not working and the toilets were smelly. This time I had to book my tickets with Air India (no other option was availiable) and I felt a good change in the customer service and the aircraft itself. The crew was quite attentive this time and were happy to serve. They were smiling and friendly. The seats were quite uncomfortable but the enetertainment systems were working fine. Food served was good, although the gap between the second and last meal was quite a long. However when asked they offered juice and half sandwich to me. Toilets were clean and after experiencing a positive change I felt that they deserve a good review too."
756,"Melbourne to Delhi with Air India, and never Again. I was given a voucher in Melbourne for a hotel layover in Delhi. I misplaced it, and informed the airline before I boarded the flight. They told me not to worry, as the voucher was only for my records and that the hotel at Delhi airport had all of my details. Of course, I should have worried.  The hotel receptionist in Delhi just kept on repeating, ""I need a voucher."" He told me to see the Air India desk downstairs. Of course, there was no Air India desk. When I did track someone down, the gentleman was totally unsympathetic. He refused to help in any way whatsoever, or offer any alternative solutions. Not his problem, basically. So, either I was lied to in the first place, or the staff member in Delhi just couldn't be bothered doing anything about it. Or both. As for the flight: it took place totally in daylight, although you wouldn't know it. Within ten minutes of lift-off, the windows were tinted black, and nobody could do anything about it for the next twelve hours. The reading light was inoperable too, so the whole trip was a bit like a Gothic nightmare. The inflight entertainment system contained few options, and most of those were pretty uninspiring. The service was minimal and mostly unsmiling, and the food was only just passable. And the flight was one hour late to depart and two hours late to arrive. Definitely not recommended. Spend the extra money and buy a quality travel experience."
757,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Air India. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi to connect with AI314 to Hong Kong, departing at 11pm. In Delhi I lost my boarding pass, and alerted the crew at the gate immediately. They sent me running to the duty free to check if they had found it, but when I ran back telling them that I didn't find it, they told me they wouldn't be able to reissue me with a new one, and that I'd have to rebook on the same flight 24 hours later. I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport. This seven hour ordeal is not over yet, as I am writing this review from Delhi airport, 27 hours after initially leaving Mumbai. The direct flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong is only just over 5 hours. Air India have wasted my time, money, and have shown themselves to be a company with a culture of complete indifference towards their customers. I may have lost my boarding pass, but these things happen, and some understanding and assistance on their part would have been greatly appreciated. To add to my negative experience, two of their crew told me - separately - that they would have issued me with a new boarding pass had they been working at the desk at the time. Air India deprived me of sleep, wasted my time, and also my money, for something that could've been taken care of easily and left me a satisfied customer."
758,"✅ Verified Review |  Chicago to Delhi with Air India. Food not good quality and not up to international standards. The lunch that was served had a hard dinner roll as bread with the curry. I have flown on Etihad as well which was a 14 hours flight from the US and the quality of food was much better. The staff only do what is required, nothing more. No water during rest hours. They served lunch and then vanished. Every other airline makes sure to serve passengers something every 3-4 hours. Air India staff just do the basics.
"
759,"✅ Verified Review |  Air India from Mumbai to Bangalore return.  I was a bit skeptical of the timings as they tend to reschedule a lot based on others experiences. However, my both flights were close to schedule, with a slight 20-min delay which is common when flying in and out of Mumbai. The best part of the flight was surprisingly, the crew who were mostly young and going out of their way on the service front. Food was decent too. I got to fly on the classic A320 on the return leg, which was old but a nice memory for sure. Their seats/leg room is better than other Indian carriers, especially if one happens to be above 6ft. The only glitch I faced from them was for the seat selection, which I had selected for both flights, but at checkin found I was on different seats for both legs. The overall experience however was pleasant, with both the nice and swank BOMT2 and BLR terminals."
760,"New Delhi to Mumbai and my first time with Air India. By far, the worst air travel of my life. The flight from New Delhi to Mumbai was scheduled at 11PM. We were informed in the morning that it was late by 30 minutes. So far so good. We checked-in at 7PM only to realize the flight is now delayed until after 2:30AM. The staff at the gate seemed inexperienced and didn't know how to respond to queries from passengers who were quite upset already. We kept being told they would be ready in 15 minutes. Passengers with family suffered the most where their kids were sleeping almost on the floor."
761,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Abu Dhabi via Delhi with Air India. Worst business class experience so far. We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed. The shabbiness of the plane and the uninspired, almost reluctant service is not a financial problem, it's an attitude issue."
762,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew Air India from Newark to Mumbai and back this April. The flight from Newark left on time and landed in Mumbai before time (4.00 pm Indian time). The flight was nearly half empty and was smooth. However, the aircraft interior was very dull and not properly maintained. All three in-flight entertainment systems (including the two next to my seats) and their controls were not working. Seats were torn, and reading lights were also not working. Imagine how a person can survive such an ultra-long haul flight without any entertainment or reading! Many places, they put duct tape to cover the cracks below the entertainment system and tray. Just within three hours into the flight, the toilets were very smelly. The food was ok. However, the cabin crews were not professional and pleasant. They were taking so much rest in between for many hours without providing any service or refreshments. Same as the case with my return flight (AI 191), which was delayed by one hour to take off due to some technical issues."
763,"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I flew Air Canada from Toronto to Dubai, and Air India from Dubai. Trip was uneventful. Now it was time to come back to Canada. Our flight was confirmed from Mumbai to Dubai. Halt for 2 hrs in Dubai and then Air Canada from Dubai to Toronto. All seemed simple, but when we went to Mumbai airport (4hrs prior to our departure time), we were told that Air India will not fly us to Dubai because ""they got message from Air Canada in Dubai, that we may miss our flight as our halt in Dubai is only 2hrs and there won't be other flight for next 24hrs"". My son from Toronto, called Air Canada (same time we were still at the Mumbai Airport) and they confirmed it was a lie. Only to found out later that Air India overbooked their Dubai flight and looked every excuse in the book to keep us back. They tried to fly us thru London, UK and asked my son to Call Air Canada to arrange for our flight from London to Toronto. When my son called Air Canada, they confirmed that Air India is lying and it's their responsibility (as an operating airline) to get us to our destination. They wouldn't even offer us a hotel in Mumbai. No meals. Even dared to offer us refund and find our own way back home! Their plan was to strand us in Mumbai without being responsible for anything! After long arguments, they finally put us on Lufthansa (7 hrs after our original departing time) but made sure they informed Lufthansa not to issue us a wheel chair. I am 75 and my wife is 67. I just had knee surgery and they could clearly see we were struggling! "
764,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Delhi return with Air India, and I was surprised with the improvement on the last flight. On the ground they continue to be chaotic and disorganised, though. Departure time re-scheduled 3 times within 24 hours (the last being brought forward by 90 mins 3 hours before the flight!); fee for flight change was quoted from £100 to £250 where the website says £100. They used to be appalling onboard too, but I often used them because the timing suited me, and they offered the best seat comfort as compared to other airlines on this route, and they were often much cheaper. Service always suffered with indifference and bad training. On my last flight though, both in and out, the service and care was excellent.  Hope it continues, and of course my family and I will continue, even if they don't improve for my reasons given above.
"
765,"✅ Verified Review |  This is the domestic leg of the Paris to Chennai flight via Delhi, and operates from the international terminal of Delhi T3. I had done a web check-in and the ground staff told me that the Boarding Pass that I had was not valid for the international side of T3! So, he generated an Airline Boarding pass and gave it to me. I found at least 50 passengers waiting in queue to check-in and the whole process was so slow! The ground personnel was sharp to inform me that the Gate (no.10) is 1 km away and that I should take precaution to reach it on time! However, inflight the service was excellent and  cabin crew have started smiling and are more motivated now than a year back. Quality of food was good. Flight landed ahead of schedule and on the whole the flight was very pleasant. Air India needs to take urgent measures on the ground to speed-up check-in, especially in busy airports."
766,✅ Verified Review |  Lucknow to Delhi with Air India. The aircraft was clean and the seats provided ample seating space. The cabin crew was friendly on the short haul of 45 mins between LKO-DEL. The snacks provided were enough for this short flight and the quality was very good. The fare was reasonably priced (with 25 kgs baggage allowance). I would recommend Air India.
767,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to London Heathrow on Air India, the check in was smooth, and the flight took off almost on time. Air India operates Boeing 787 on this route, it was my first flight on this aircraft and I found it impressive. Cabin noise was low and there was enough space in economy. The crew was good but food served was poor both in breakfast and lunch. 
"
768,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Mumbai with Air India. Somewhat chaotic boarding, but queuing is a word that does not exist in any Hindi language. Nice cabin, 2-2-2 configuration, good entertainment system, though choice of movies not very large. As distances between seats quite long indications on screen may be difficult to read. Friendly and attentive crew. Food was well served, French wines excellent. Air India has certainly one of the worst amenities kit (socks and mask in paper bag). Prices for flight very attractive."
769,✅ Verified Review |  London to Delhi return with Air India. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this flight was. The Boeing 787 is a very nice plane and cabin crew that were looking after the passengers in my area were a credit to Air India. The food was disappointing though and the price was fairly high. But I would consider travelling with Air India again if the planes are new like this and cabin crew are of this standard. The ground services in Delhi needs to be better organised - for example the check in desks were dealing with more than one flight at a time and this was causing delays. Overall better than expected but a long way to go before Air India can be considered an airline of choice.
770,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to London. Check in smooth, was assigned seat 11A exit row first in economy. Boarding delayed by 15 mins as flight arrived late. After boarding a passenger fell sick, further 20mins went past as doctor attended him. At 8am which was already a one hour delay, ground staff came running and spoke to crew loudly that captains bag not yet loaded on the plane, as stuck in airport conveyor system. Finally at 8:30am bag loaded and flight pushed back. Funny part is that captain makes an announcement that due to several bags stuck on airport conveyor there was a delay in departure, which was a complete lie as I heard the ground staff and crew whole conversation. The crew was on their own joyride and could not care less, one of lady crew was not even wearing AI uniform Trousers and chappals, she was wearing bellbottom pants and her own home jazzy Chappals."
771,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Mumbai. I needed to change flight dates so visited the AI Bangkok office, extremely helpful and courteous staff helped me to do the changes. Check in at bangkok was very good and fast service, boarding organized. Had pre booked a Vegetarian Oriental meal which was served very promptly by the crew and was delicious. The crew on this flight was very experienced and professional, mingled with passengers while serving meals and came around again afterwards offering drinks. "
772,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Bangkok. Check in and boarding was fast, but boarding not done as per sequence. There was one crew who was not very cooperative with her seniors and fellow crew members and was arguing with them in an unpleasant and loud manner. Supper was served and was refreshing. Arrived Bangkok 35 mins ahead of schedule. Great legroom."
773,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Mumbai with Air India. Check in at Heathrow was smooth, and boarding done in an organized manner. Cabin crew did the job but very minimal interaction with passengers. Two hot meals and a drink service. Legroom was very comfortable, seats are standard 3x3x3 on Boeing 787 with 33 inch pitch. The footrest is in the shape of an inverted T which rolls - its an excellent foot massager. Flight arrived bombay ahead of schedule."
774,Chose to fly Air India from Bhopal to Delhi. It was the last departure for Delhi at 9.30pm. Standard A320 aircraft with approx 60% occupancy. Check in was slightly time consuming inspite of the 2 Air india counters open due to slight rush. Specially demanded for a window seat and got it assigned during check in. The flight departed 10 minutes before time and arrived Delhi approx 10.30pm. Was served a hot dinner on board with veg as the only option which was nice and filling. Accompanied with dessert and salad. Air India is one of those few who still serve in actual steel cutlery and has the best legspace in the skies in economy. The plane looked clean but the overhead reading light was inoperative and as usual the flight attendants tried their best to avoid smiling during all interactions. While exiting aircraft saw many seats with inflight magazines/newspapers but I wasn't provided with any. 
775,"Newark to Mumbai with Air India. The price of the ticket was quite good compared to other business class fares and it was for non stop both ways. $3890 vs almost $5800 for other one stop options. I did not expect a wide selection of western food nor entertainment. I was not wrong but what was available was adequate and I had movies etc on my iPad. I did not expect exceptional service. It was well below par of other airlines, but, it was not out of line with the value of the ticket or the non stop advantage. What got me was that so many of the seats did not work. Granted they all would be upright or completely flat. However, the foot rest did not work on any of the seats. Business class was only half full on the way out so I tried four different seats. Foot rest did not work on any of them. Not one seat was fully functional. The same was true on the return flight. I can put up with poor service and other things but a 15 hour flight needs a comfortable and functioning seat.  Would I take them again? Yes, but the ticket price would have to be at least 50% less for the equivalent cabin on other airlines."
776,"Delhi to Chicago on Air India. Web check-in didn't work out. The website will ask you million questions during the procedure and at the very end it will give you an error message (at least this happened to me). I wasted close to 3-4 hours, called the agent and got no results. Tedious process, mobile interface of Air India is awful. Check-in at the airport took me forever. Make sure to give yourself 4-5 hours for the check-in and immigration process at the Delhi airport. It took me more than 3 hours and I was running in the end to catch the flight. They have close to 4-5 international flights going pretty much at the same time. This causes heavy traffic of people and Air India is not staffed properly to manage the heavy traffic.  I was not impressed at all with the cabin staff service. They were always in rush and impolite. Also, once they served the 1st meal in the beginning (4AM in the morning), they escaped for the next 7-9 hours. No one offered water or other beverages. You will have to go personally and hunt for refreshments from their food inventory. People were very angry. In-flight entertainment: Horrible and just pray for your luck that you will get that lucky seat which will have a functional system. My system was broken. Can you imagine a 16 hour flight with a broken entertainment system? I was under impression that Air India food will be magical, but it was below average. This flight will be more comfortable if you are good sleeper and can sleep for 10-12 hours."
777,"London to Calcutta via Delhi with Air India - for both my outbound and inbound flights the inflight entertainment wasn't working. The cabin crew tried to re-boot my screen but it still didn't work. I didn't have any reading lights or call button throughout the entire flight. To complete the experience, the toilets were unspeakably dirty. I completed the feedback forms on both occasions but never had a response. It seems that Air India is totally indifferent to its customer comfort."
778,"Flew Birmingham to Amritsar return via Delhi in February / March 2016. I found Air India very pleasant, cabin crew were professional and courteous. The food was average and edible. The inflight entertainment was better than I expected, had some good films and everything worked. Had to wait about 1 hour at Delhi on the way out but we did not need to leave the aircraft, and equally on the return flight had about 1.30 hours wait and again stayed on the aircraft. I would fly with Air India again"
779,"I traveled from Air India Pantnagar to Chennai, via Delhi. I had bookings on two PNRs and it was not an issue to book my bags through to Chennai.  Last time out (on the same route) this did not happen. The flights were on time and the food served on the Delhi-Chennai sector was lovely! The staff were vibrant and made the journey comfortable.  One issue was, the aircraft is too small for a busy sector as Delhi-Chennai and that too, the last flight out of Delhi. Air India used to fly a A321 on this flight and of course, this was vulnerable to inordinate delays. Looks like Air India is working hard to redeem its position. "
780,"Terrible experience and never again with Air India! The plane was filthy - my seat even had chewing gum stuck to it. There were mosquitos everywhere, the cabin staff said they were being killed off by some fumigation they had going on, but it wasn't working! The entertainment system was experiencing technical difficulties on our first flight. On the 2nd we were subjected to the same (terrible choice) of movies on a loop across 5 channels - only one of which was in English. Why advertise on the in-flight magazine that you have 'Hollywood's latest' (The Martian, Everest etc) then put one movie in English on a loop?! When The King's Speech started playing for the 2nd time I nearly started to cry. I'd watched a Bollywood film first - but I couldn't watch it again. Definitely the worst airline I have ever encountered - cheap but definitely not cheerful. Spend more to go with SpiceJet or Indigogo - they have much better reviews."
781,"I flew direct from Birmingham to Delhi and return with Air India recently in Business Class on a Boeing 787. The flights were timely, the cabin was spacious and the cabin crew worked very hard to make everyone as comfortable as possible. Although perhaps without some of the finesse and presentation of other airlines, the food was fine. I also found the entertainment system perfectly acceptable. Most important, the outward flight was only 7 hrs 50 mins. I have travelled to India with a range of airlines - some direct and some via middle-eastern hubs. Taking all factors into consideration (duration of flight, convenience of travel to airport, space in the cabin, waiting times for transfer flights and value for money) I would travel with this airline by choice on my next trip to India."
782,London Heathrow to Delhi with Air India. We have been travelling for over 30 years and never experienced such poor service. Our flight times changed with no explanation or apology. Crew rude and have no idea about customer care. Toilets were dirty. Not fit for purpose.  Will not be using then again
783,"Birmingham to Chennai via Delhi with Air India. All the 4 flights ( 2 in each direction - connecting fights) were delayed with no announcement let alone an apology. To add insult to injury they lost my wife's luggage. It never arrived. They just missed loading into the flight. We have a 1 year old baby and needed all his feeding equipment, food stuff, clothes - everything essential basically. They are so incompetent you would be gobsmacked. Absolutely shocking and utterly disgraceful. "
784,"Took a number of flights on Air India, Delhi - Bagdogra return, Delhi to Mumbai on to Goa. The flights were fine and I was impressed with the leg room. Food was good curry as expected. Staff a little surely and the entertainment was not working but it was just short haul. I would use Air India for internal flights not sure I would want to go long haul on Air India. The toilets were poor as well but usable. The flights were booked in advance and comparable to Ryanair for budget but you also got something to eat that was a nice bonus."
785,"I read a lot of very negative reviews of Air india, and was quite nervous of what to expect when we flew from London to Kolkata return via Delhi in January 2016. It was a lot better than we expected. The Boeing 787's used on the route helped, being new(ish) with mostly working in-flight entertainment. Usually either the touchscreen or the keypad was non-responsive on each unit, but luckily not both. The choice of entertainment was fairly limited but adequate for a return long-haul trip. The cabin crew were polite and delivered the children's meals we'd ordered (after being asked) and the children's meals were the expected bland fish fingers and pasta affair. The food on the return leg from India was some of the best airline food I'd had. The cabin crew didn't circulate after meal times, but snacks / drinks were available on a trolley at the rear. The toilets were not well maintained on the long haul leg, and the one nearest to us was almost unusable by the end of the flight. Others were slightly better. Our bags were checked through the transfer, and arrived as expected. There were no flight delays. Overall, it was OK, and I might even fly with them again."
786,"Birmingham to Bangkok return via Delhi. I've ben traveling for 40 years and have to say Air India has been my worst ever flying experience. Do not expect to get to your destination on time. Had to wait 3 hours on Bangkok's runway, and missed my connecting flight from Delhi to Birmingham, so had to wait 24hrs in Delhi for the next flight. On way back delays again, then had to wait 36 hrs for my case that was left in Delhi. No feedback from them. I would never travel with them again. Forget how tempting their fares may be."
787,"Hyderabad to Delhi with Air India, and it is one of the worst airlines I have flown. The cabin crew lacked hospitality and the aircraft was poorly maintained. The airport service was also bad, with poorly trained staff having limited knowledge. Overall, a lack of professionalism, processes and poor management. Standards are not up to the mark of a national carrier."
788,"We recently toured cities on River Ganga - Haridwar, Rishikesh, Varanasi and Allahabad. Our tour operator used various airlines; Air India, Jet Airways and Spicejet. Our worst experience was with Air India. Ahmedabad to Delhi flight (AI 011) was delayed by over 3 hours. No apologies from crew including the pilot and his first officer for the delay and inconvenience caused. Only cheese sandwics and water were offered. That is perhaps okay for a short flight. The toilets were not properly cleaned after the previous flight. Toilet rolls were offered instead of paper towels. The cabin staff were really not interested in what they were doing. Our return flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad (AI013) was even worse. My wife I were seated separately. The cabin staff were rude.  Toilets unclean and again toilet rolls for paper towels. In contrast Jet Airways and Spice were on time, with cleaner aircrafts, polite crew and better snacks"
789,"Varanasi to Amritsar via Delhi with Air India. The first flight was delayed which meant that we missed the second flight Air India sent us to a poor hotel - no dinner, no paper in the bathrooms, no towels and no heater, although I asked. No breakfast at 6.30am , when I must return to airport, being afraid about what would happen next with our flights."
790,"Air India ruined the end of our holiday, flying from Colombo to Paris via Delhi. Flight from Colombo was not at 8:20 am but 12:20pm, so we arrived late at Delhi and missed the flight. About 20 people were already arguing with the staff at the transfer and after 4 hours they said that they will try to put us on a flight from another airline. Between this time no excuses, they were asking us to wait till midnight (about 12 hrs waiting for maybe nothing) - at the transfer finally after this time they propose us a room because they were impossible to give us a flight. After an awful night, we had a boarding pass at 12.40 pm but 1 hour late again! I asked them the official delad paper, they promised this, but I had to run after it. I also asked them to check if my luggage was in the plane because I know that they are incompetent. Now, after 25 hours later, one day of work missed, my luggage is still in Delhi after they promise me that it is the plane. We lose so much energy and when you see other people who had the same problems as us, you don't understand how Air India can be in Star Alliance - they don't deserve it. Just pay a bit more money and have no stress."
791,I will not recommend or travel with Air India again. We were travelling from Birmingham to Bangkok via Delhi on our honeymoon. We were delayed for nearly 30 hours in Birmingham - what a start! Staff were rude and most unhelpful. Since returning from my holiday I have made a number of attempts to speak with someone regarding my complaint to no avail. Poor customer service and most uncomfortable flights.
792,I had a really bad experience with Air India from Goa to London via Delhi. and our flights were delayed. No assistance flying with a child. Food was really bad.  Delhi to London didn't offer any version of non Indian or not spicy food. It's very challenging to travel 10 hours with a child in these conditions.
793,"When Air India announced its San Francisco to Delhi non-stop flights, I was quite excited to have a new option. I was hopeful that it had evolved from its delay and lost luggage days to give competition a bang for its frequent flyer miles. I still remember the stress my mom went through years ago when AI misplaced our bag containing my birth certificate (from Denmark), and other important docs. Fast forward 30 or so years to our flight last week from Delhi to SFO. After a nearly three-hour delay, we landed in SFO to find one of our bags missing. After the obligatory filed complaint, we have called several times a day only to be told that it 'may' show up on the next flight. We're not the only ones. Two weeks ago, they replaced my nephew's expensive sitar! How do you misplace a sitar?? Air India, it's time to grow up and take responsibility. Or, graciously surrender ""your place in the sky."" "
794,"We travelled Delhi to Melbourne return on Air India - on Delhi to Melbourne route there was no entertainment system functioning, and everything was of very poor standard from the state of the aircraft to standard of customer care. However the real drama was on the journey from Melbourne to Delhi. On arrival at Delhi we were told all our bags were left deliberately at Melbourne and it took 7 days for Air India to get the bags back from Melbourne to India. The phone number given to us at Delhi airport could never be reached. We had to employ an agent in Jaipur to get our bags retrieved, after hundreds of phone calls and after seven days the only place Air India could get the bags back was in Jaipur airport. Our internal flight with Air India was rescheduled and cancelled at the last minute. This was from Goa to Delhi via Mumbai. This is a shameful airline, who managed to ruin our trip. They do not care about their customer. "
795,"Several domestic flights last year and all of them delayed. Old crew, but fairly pleasant. Food was edible enough. Dimapur to Kolkata was first delayed by 4 hours and eventually cancelled. Had to reschedule my connecting flight to Mumbai without any help from ground crew who abandoned me after handing a hotel voucher. I was lucky compared to people who were travelling on longer connections - a couple of people were en route to DEL and then LHR, and were unable to find any seats on the DEL-LHR flight for 3 days.  Nightmare for everyone. Flight did take off the next day eventually, after an hour's delay. Also did several Mumbai to Delhi return flights. Despite operating out of new terminals at either airport, we were made to board and deplane by bus on several occasions. International flights are better, but lacklustre in the face of competition. "
796,"Every time I have flown Air India I swear never to do it again. But sometimes it is the only available option. This time the flight was from Udaipur to London via Delhi, with a 9 hour wait in Delhi. The flight from Udaipur was delayed by 4 hrs 30 minutes. No information. No word of explanation or apology. Just a crowd of confused and increasingly irritable passengers. The late arrival in Delhi was of no consequence to me, as I had another 4hrs 30 minutes to wait before my flight. But I discovered that though I was checked through for both flights and had boarding cards for both, I could not go through security for another 2 hrs. I had to wait in the forecourt where there is no comfortable seating and only the most basic facilities. Air India counter staff were a model of indifference and unhelpfulness. There followed a 10 hour flight to London. First meal (dinner?) was a stale croissant, half a wilted brownie, a piece of grated carrot the size of a fingernail, and a watery cup of something that was called coffee but tasted of washing up liquid. Second meal (breakfast?) was a repeat of the first: a stale croissant, half a wilted brownie, a piece of grated carrot the size of a fingernail, and a watery cup of something called coffee. No drinks were offered beyond little plastic bottles of packaged drinking water (Bombay municipal tap water?). I don't expect culinary miracles at 40,000 ft, but it would have been nice to have something edible. The seating was fine (apart from the broken food tray). No complaints about leg-room. But the cabin service was slow and surly. The toilets were smelly, IFE was virtually non-existent, and the Wi-Fi had a permanent 'glitch'. There was a feel of grubbiness and neglect everywhere - and this in a virtually new aircraft. But this time they didn't lose my baggage. And the flight arrived only one hour late (no word of explanation or apology). So all-in-all this was my best experience of Air India yet. Things are looking up!"
797,"Mumbai to New York JFK via Delhi on Air India. Broken seating, entertainment consoles that don't work, dirt, lost baggage, unannounced stop-overs, overstuffed overhead baggage compartments, unhelpful staff. This airline used to be top-notch back in the 70's, but is now little more than cattle-truck service. I am embarrassed by this national carrier and will never use Air India again."
798,"Flew Air India Dubai to Delhi return.  Boeing 787 with a spacious cabin and excellent leg room. The service is a bit lethargic and inflight entertainment is not the most engrossing compared to other airlines. Food and beverages were up to the mark. The staff seems a bit unprofessional as it took loads of time at check-in at Delhi. Even the cabin staff seems drained out and it's not the most cordial staff you would encounter on a trip. IFE can be improved as the content is not enough, and is pretty slow and primitive considering it is a new aircraft. On the flight from Delhi to Dubai, the cabin crew ran out of vegetarian food which resulted in chaos and people just getting half the meal. Air India was a better option to fly to Delhi over competitors mainly due to the cabin and food."
799,"Air India managed to turn a short 45 min flight from Goa to Mumbai into a incredible stressful experience. We booked Air India as it was the national airline as we thought it would be the best - firstly both flights were delayed. Coming back we boarded 2 hours late and then waited on the Tarmac for another hour, we were told it was because the airport was very busy but almost every other airline went on the time. Also no information is given, finally we arrive in Mumbai and have to wait another 1.5 hrs for our luggage. People missed ongoing flights but Air India gave no more information. Having spoke to many locals they told us never to use Air India as it has such a bad record."
800,"Air India from London to Cochin via Delhi. Customer service was poor, staff failed to inform that it's possible to use your mobile to scan in the boarding pass as I did the online checking. I was sent all over the place to get one printed and at that time the check in had closed, I was then sent to the front desk where they then tried to sell me another ticket and all I needed was the boarding pass. I was traveling light and could have made it, in the end I went home missing my friends wedding and with the new found knowledge of never using them or ebookers again."
801,"Check-in nightmare! Our tickets on Air India from Delhi to Shanghai then United to San Francisco, clearly stated no charge for up to 2 bags each of up to 23kg. When we presented our 4 bags within these parameters, the desk agent refused to check us in, unless we paid an extra US $400. We refused and appealed up 2 levels and finally got checked in. Even though we had arrived 3 hours before departure time, because the whole process took so long, we were rushed to make our flight. The flight itself was not bad. The plane, food and service were fine. Lost luggage! 1 week after arrival, our luggage has never arrived. Is this because of incompetence or some kind or revenge because we did not pay their extra fees? "
802,"Air India from Bangkok to London Heathrow via Mumbai. Staff friendly, main food dishes nice and thankfully Indian as expected which surprised me when a few other reviews read are somehow expecting other than an Indian spicy offerings perhaps? You can request special meals in advance when booking usually? Breakfast on 2nd leg lacked any flavour sadly, still not sure what sort of omelette type dish it was supposed to be, edible but not enjoyable would best sum that moment up. Drinks offered and on 2nd leg of trip quite frequently, asked for red wine and got given 2 small bottles which was a pleasant surprise, whereas stated they had run out after just 1 serving on 1st leg out of BKK. Flights both smooth considering gale force winds upon landing in LHR, good piloting skills I thought. Overall better than expected, seat comfort not too bad for someone tall, good 34' seat pitch which is becoming rarer these days sadly and cost of fights appealing and good vfm if not necessarily ideal with a 7+ hr stopover. Both flights on time, cabin announcements and safety seat belt warnings very good, have flown far worse and would say yes to flying again just preferably without a Mumbai layover for which such a new airport seriously lacks amenities of transit seating for such high passenger numbers and a transit hotel that should be located within the airport terminal and not something requiring a transit visa at outrageous and prohibitive prices for foreigners!"
803,"Mumbai to Newark with Air India. Ground Service with poorly trained staff with limited knowledge. Had to get supervisor help for through check in of baggage from origin. Boarding passes needs to collected at every transit station. Feels like everyone is a trainee. The food onboard is Indian cuisine and was fine. No beverage service at all unless you ask for it.  Seats were comfortable, carpets looked weary.  Half of the IFE have some issues with remote or touch screen (similar experience in CDG-DEL and DEL-TRV flights). Cabin staff was okay and did their duties. No Wifi but charging ports were available. Flight was on time, though other flights in this trip were significantly late. Very little cinformation provided to passengers on delays. Lack of professionalism, processes and poor management very obvious. "
804,"Hyderabad to Newark via Mumbai with Air India. Seating arrangement was good, mobile charging socket was helping a lot, but the food service was very late, and no juice or drinks in between. They also give food and coffee/tea at the same time, and the coffee was disgusting. The cabin staff just wasn't there to complete their duty."
805,"Mumbai to Singapore return in economy with Air India. Both flights left on time and reached before time. Outward flight was at midnight, no proper food served, only some mediocre snacks and cheap sweet dish was given. No drinks at all. Return flight was at 8pm, drinks and dinner with veg and nonveg options provided. Cabin crew all over about 45 years of age. IFE had good options but headphones didn't work properly. I was happy with flight map only though. Charging point at every seat is a good surprise. Overall Air India with the Boeing 787 is a good combination. "
806,"Sydney- to Rome via New Delhi return. Air India did not process my and my wife's frequent flyer points despite being provided with appropriate membership numbers. Numerous interventions after returning brought no solution. It looks like Air India tries to save money and cheats on its custemers. In addition, flights are being cancelled to fill in the planes. No more flying with Air India for me and my friends!"
807,"Melbourne to Delhi with Air India. I will never again travel with Air India. First of all the flight was uncomfortable and terrible service. The flight was late by 2 hrs and then once you reached Delhi they have lost their luggage. No Baggage has been brought from Melbourne because of excessive weight - so why include the luggage in the ticket. Then it was been told that luggage will be delivered tomorrow. No phone call from the baggage department whether they have got any luggage or not. Called several times, nobody knows nothing about it. Called Delhi Air India they asked us to call Australia, Australia one vice versa. "
808,"We flew Air India Boeing 787 from Delhi to Sydney. Check in etc went without a hitch, I'm a senior so my wife and I boarded early. Our seats were at the very back, a pair just forward of the galley. The cabin crew were smiling, helpful Indians serving meals, drinks, blankets etc. An hour of delayed departure and a late arrival. The meals were adequate, there was plenty to drink, my screen didn't work but I didn't care, I napped easily. Comfortable seats, plenty of leg room and I'm 6ft plus. I would fly this sector with Air India again. "
809,"Travelled Air India from Melbourne to Delhi last night. Flight was delayed an hour, but I was happy to receive an email and a courtesy call the day before. Everything went fine for check-in. Once we were in the plane for our 13-hour journey, it was downhill. Plane was delayed another hour due to ""baggage problems"" while we sat in the cabin. No infant seatbelts. No crew checking passengers for safe takeoff and landing. No greeting or anything from the captain. Plane in darkness for 13 hours (no window blinds, dark tinted windows that we couldn't control) except for food service. No one responding to passengers calls for service. I had to go to the galley each time I needed a drink, where the crew were chatting behind a curtain and ignoring all the passenger service calls. During food service, attendant spilt hot coffee over my mother with no apology. Ordinary food. When we landed in Delhi, after waiting for ages for our luggage at the carousel, we finally approached a staff member (we noticed others doing the same) who let us know all our baggage was still in Melbourne and would take 2 days to arrive. It wasn't lost, they just left it there. They knew they were leaving Melbourne without a planeload of luggage (we were told some bull story about temperature being too high) and didn't even have the courtesy to tell us not to wait at the carousel in Delhi. No notification, no apology. There followed another chunk of time full of confusion, filling in lost luggage forms with a planeload of other passengers, and seeing a bunch of clueless, disorganised staff around the airport. No compensation except a tiny bottle of water. Honestly, considering they should have had 13 hours of foreknowledge about receiving a planeload of grumpy, luggage less passengers, they could have handled it a lot better. Hopefully our luggage arrives tomorrow. How is that acceptable conduct for an airline? Just hopeless."
810,"Melbourne to Delhi with Air India. Plane was average, air hostesses were okay but thats about it. The flight was delayed twice due to no apparent reason. They lost the baggage of over 50+ people on the plane. The staff at the airport lied to us to get us off their backs, that your baggage will be delivered next day. 4 days later I'm still waiting for any communication from the airline. When you call the lost baggage claim center they never answer the phone and when they do they always say something different. No one who works for this airline cares about customer service, I don't think they know what it means. I have no hope of receiving my baggage or any compensation as I'm in India for another 8 days. Stay away from AIr India as this is the worst airline ever."
811,"New York to Delhi with Air India, and the only thing I loved about this flight was the food. It was the best Indian airplane food i have had in a long time. Other than that the service was horrible, the bathrooms were dirty and the attendants were rude compared to other flights. If we asked them for water or a beverage or snacks they would behave in an unsual way. I wouldn't recommend this flight."
812,"Chennai to London via Delhi with Air India. As one of the passengers trapped in Chennai Airport during the floods from the 1st to 5th of December, I was appalled at the treatment of passengers. We were given no food or water or blankets by the airline. The airline sent people out to the domestic terminal, which left them effectively locked out in the cyclone, and then barricaded off the window so that people could not contact them from outside. They shouted at passengers and refused to put passengers on the emergency evacuation list. They would just write ""total refund"" on the tickets and say they had absolved responsibility of us. The staff in Chennai airport did not show a shred of compassion or humanity. I understand it was exceptional circumstances but when things go wrong you cannot count on Air India to provide you with basic care or support."
813,"Air India from Riyadh to Nagpur via Mumbai. The flight was delayed for 2 hours due to technical problems. We were served meals on the ground, the meal was not bad. The IFE worked this time but there was not much to watch. The Second flight was also delayed by 30 mins. They served snacks, the experience was not bad, the negative part being delays and the aircraft were dirty."
814,Mumbai to Jodhpur with Air India. The check in at BOM was quite quick. Flight delayed and the airline informed us. At the airport though it was delayed again but only found this out at the gate. The flight was uneventful. The food was terrible and service was alright. Return flight was better. Check in fast. Food edible and service was with a semi smile. Flight early and reached on time.
815,"These Air India flights were both on time, and the crew while not overly friendly certainly was not indifferent, in fact one of the stewardesses was nice and helped out with my seats (I had reserved the exit row, but on an online map that was for the 777 - this being the 787 the configuration was different but the stewardess got me the exit row despite this being a full flight). The food is another plus and better than some other airlines. The downside was the Inflight Entertainment system - I'd have thought this being a new Boeing 787 it would be particularly good but my poor neigbhbour's system was not working."
816,"Delhi to Frankfurt on Air India and I was not expecting too much. A new Boeing 787 with comfortable seats, enough leg room, entertainment system working fine. Worst part was the cabin crew, they only smiled when passengers were getting off from aircraft as if they waiting for that to happen. I have traveled with Air India on domestic sectors earlier and the crew was far better. Nevertheless, the overall experience was good. Reasonable price, comfortable aircraft, food was OK, not much choices in beverages. "
817,"Air India from Delhi to Bangalore return. Check in fast. However, when I checked my boarding pass, lounge invitation and baggage tag alarmingly realised that I had someone elses. Immediately told check in lady, who could not care less until I raised my voice. It took quite an effort to get bags retagged and issue corrected. Thankfully I had come to airport well ahead of time. Flight departed on time. Crew so so. IFE not working. Food so so. Seat comfort okay. Baggage delivery in BLR was fast. However, on return to DEL it took well over an hour. Issue with AI is, It is overstaff with most employees who do virtually nothing or do not take pride in their job."
818,"I was travelling Air India from Kolkata to Dubai via Mumbai. I arrived airport 4 hours before. While checking in I got information that flight had been cancelled from Kolkata to Mumbai via Hydrabad. I was shocked and I had to catch my connecting flight from Mumbai to Dubai. They gave me option to travel at night but at 8pm I had to catch my flight from Mumbai for Dubai. After lots of discussions and arguments they gave me other option to travel next day and agreed to give me another ticket for next day.  After lots of arguments they transferred me to Jet Airways, finally I reached to Mumbai. If they had given information for the cancellation of flight I would had not faced these problems. If I had not reached airport 4 hours before then I had no option to reach Mumbai to catch the connecting flight. "
819,"We flew Air India roundtrip from JFK to Delhi Business Class. It was OK both ways. Flights left on time. Beds went almost flat. What I did not like was the seat configuration of 2-4-2, unusual in Business Class, and there was no privacy. Their price was much cheaper than competitors so it was good value. Food quality was not up to international standards. That was the main negative. Movie choices just OK and audio visual difficult to use. Pajamas were a nice touch. I read previous reviews of inattentive cabin staff. I did not find this to be the case. Staff was attentive and cabin and bathrooms were kept clean. For the money it was a good deal. Lounges at JFK and Delhi were just okay with very poor selections of food. The whole issue with Air India is the food on the trip and in the lounges. If I was going again and I could get the price I would fly them again especially since you avoid connections in Europe and save a lot of time by going nonstop."
820,"Flew Air India from Seoul to Hong Kong. First time flying them and overall impressed. Check-in was fast and efficient, I could have upgraded for $200 AUD but decided not to and boarding the Boeing 787 was done in a calm manner. Had a delay of 1 hour due to a sick passenger wanting to deplane. After takeoff I was served peanuts and a coke, then 45 mins later was served a delicious chicken curry with rice/chutney, salad, roll and dessert. Inflight entertainment with plenty of selection. Cabin crew attentive. Look forward to flying Air India again."
821,"Travelled Air India with my wife from London Heathrow to Sydney via Delhi on 16th November, and the service was appalling. The staff didn't seem at all interested and were quite untidy. What a difference on the next leg where staff were professional and we really enjoyed that part of the trip. On the basis of the flight London to Delhi, I would say don't use this airline but the second flight changed my thinking a little. I am now undecided and we'll wait and see what the return journey is like."
822,"I wanted to visit Delhi and Goa and Air India fly direct from Birmingham, UK. We were 2 couples travelling together (total 4 people) I have never dealt with such a shoddy airline. I booked 3 flights from Birmingham to Goa via Delhi, and from Delhi to Birmingham. The flight times were changed twice prior to departure and changed 5 times after booking. The 5th time it changed it messed up my connecting flight home from Delhi to Birmingham. So I had to change the domestic flight to the day before and lose a day in Goa. . Once I had changed this flight to the day before I had an email saying this flight time had changed and then a few days later I got another email saying it had changed again. The plane was the oldest I've ever been on. 3 out of the 4 TVs in our seats were broken. AI113 flight time changed twice as well. Once the day before departure and once on the morning of departure. Luckily I was able to connect to wifi and see my emails as if I hadn’t I wouldn’t of found out about it."
823,"I travel by Air India quite often, it has records for delay in flight always. But this time I had a bad experience and i have decided that I am never going to travel in Air India again. My flight was from Bangalore to Silchar via Guwahati. I was supposed to change my flight in Guwahati. But due to delay in flight as usual, it decided to go directly to Silchar without changing. Captain made an announcement about that. But as all know, maximum people usually don't hear the announcement with full concentration, I heard it but still to confirm about that I went to ask Air India staff, he just shouted like anything, saying ""Can't you listen announcement has been made?"", like me most of the passenger went to confirm about that, he shouted at everyone. I didn't like the behavior at all. I have traveled by other airlines also I didn't experience any such things. If you ask them they will reply in a good way. But this experience with Air India is horrible. They should know how to behave with passengers."
824,"Twice in a row I had terrible experiences with Air India due to the airline's disorganization and inability to run their flights as scheduled. For my flight from Myanmar to Kolkata on Feb 27, the airline sent an email the afternoon of my evening flight saying the flight time had been moved up by two hours! I had to rush home from a goodbye lunch to pack and get to the airport quickly, and then the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours from the new time. The fact that Air India thinks it's okay to move up the flight time at the last minute is a sign of their general disregard for the customer. On my next flight from Delhi to New York, the airline canceled my night time direct flight and combined it with the 10:30 flight the next morning. I was already on my way to Delhi when I received a text about the change and had to scramble at the airport to get a last-minute hotel room in Delhi, which the airline did not compensate me for. The Air India web site still showed the original flight time and the Air India staff at Delhi took a while to search and confirm that the flight was indeed cancelled. A very poorly run airline."
825,"Heathrow to Delhi with Air India was perfectly acceptable. This was a new 787 and consequently the seats were decent, legroom was better than average, and the entertainment screen was big and bright. Food was mixed - the main was excellent, the breakfast omelette was pretty grim. Several gin and tonics were provided. Biggest downside was the lack of film selection on the entertainment system - maybe they're concentrating on Bollywood, I don't know. I chose Air India based on price, and I would happily do so again."
826,"My experience with this Air India flight was painful and I am not sure if they ever read this and change their process. I was travelling to Kolkata from New York via Delhi. I was supposed to take the next flight from Delhi to Kolkata, 2 hours after reaching Delhi. But I came to know in the last moment that I have to do the customs in Delhi, gather my baggage, re-check and submit my baggage for the flight to Kolkata, and then take the Kolkata flight. All of this in just 2 hours. But surprisingly, the other connecting flight which is after 5 hours wait time in Delhi, automatically checks the baggage (through check in) at Delhi, and we can get in Kolkata for baggage and Customs.  Food and beverage service onboard was very poor. The overhead reading lamp does not work, and the staff was ill behaving when they see another customer requesting something."
827,"Delhi to Heathrow on Air India. The food and beverage service on the flight was poor, with the selection of drinks being extremely limited.  The cleanleness of the aircraft was good, however the side of my seat half of the plastic panel was missing. I discovered that the control for my seat did not work at all, resulting in me having and limited control of the entertainment system. The faulty control also resulted in me being unable to call for service or turn on the reading light. This was not limited to me, with multiple rows of seats experience the issue. Comfort was lacking as seats were extremely narrow. Overall the experience of our flight was poor."
828,"Flew Air India from Lucknow to New Delhi on A321. Check-in bags have to be screened first before you can be processed at the airline check-in counter. Despite the fact that airline associate had just finished arguing with another passenger over baggage fees, he was very polite and professional while checking us in. The baggage fees have to be paid in another part of the airport, which is inconvenient for passengers. While on-board, I loved the colorful upholstery on the seats. The sandwiches provided by Air India were delicious."
829,"The plane was new and the flight was comfortable, however several details were already broken like the reading lamps (at least mine). The staff very rude and the food was poor. The ground services and the customer service was the worst that I have seen. "
830,"Air India from Chicago to Delhi direct flight was the most horrible flight I have taken. Flight leaves and arrives on time. Cheapest and fastest flight to Delhi. Broken seats : almost 30% seats have some maintenance issues. Broken TV Screens.  90 mins after take-off from Chicago lunch will be served. After that no service at all for another 9 hours. If you ask you can get sandwiches from galley area, same thing applies to drinks.  Some toilets are broken. Staff say since this is 15 hours flight they don't have enough storage for food supplies so they can not cater 3 meals or offer drinks (except orange juice in the galley. Flight info system was unavailable or switched off during entire flight. Announcement made by captain and crew during flight was not audible and not clear. Baggage delayed by more than 45 minutes. "
831,"I was unsure about flying with Air India and decided to buy the round trip from JFK to Delhi because it was convenient and the cheapest. I was pleasantly surprised with the business class seats. They gave a night suit in business class, and the service of air hostesses was a welcome change. The flight was comfortable."
832,"Had a morning Air India flight from Chennai to Singapore with a connecting flight back to Melbourne the same day. Was worried about the connection as I was flying Air India, but was the cheapest ticket flying out of Chennai at that time and never flew on the Boeing 787 so decided to take the risk. Got to the airport three hours early but no one was servicing the Air India counter which really got me worried that the flight was delayed and I would miss my connecting flight. The check in counter finally opened 2 hours before the flight and was really slow, however they did manage to check everyone through and the flight did depart on time surprisingly. Flight was comfortable and impressed how clean the aircraft was and the crew were friendly and professional. IFE was average but easy to navigate. The meals were nothing to write home about, I had the veg option which was bland but they did have a non veg option as well. First time in a very long time flying Air India and would fly again."
833,"Singapore to Delhi with Air India. Boeing 787 interior looks well-mantained. Meal was served shortly after takeoff. Special meals were pre-booked but was not delivered nor mentioned by the flight crew. Only water, coffee and tea were served and other beverages were only available on request. In-flight entertainment has limited choices but okay for a five hour flight."
834,Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu with Air India. Aircraft interior looks aged. Refreshments were served on the Delhi-Jammu flight sector with a choice of coffee or tea. Stopover at Jammu was quick and took-off on schedule. Not much interaction between the crew and the passengers was seen throughout the flight.
835,"Air India are absolute hopeless. I was travelling Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi with my 4 month old son. We were told that the bassinet was confirmed at the time of booking the ticket, but did not get one and when I asked the flight attendant was very rude. Didn't even provide me with water for the baby food, I had to get water myself from the galley area every time. They absolutely don't care. The worst airline crew."
836,"Pre flight was a bit of a concern as Air India retimed the flights at least six times based on the alerts I received despite the fact that the final time was exactly what I booked - they were late anyway! BOM-DEL on A321 was a pleasant surprise. Cabin welcoming but a bit battered, business class seat was OK for shorthaul. Breakfast was fantastic - cereal, croissants, fruit, hot main, choice of tea. Transfer at Delhi for the flight to Sydney was okay but could have been a lot better. Boeing 787 cabin colour scheme is a bit rich but  a bit different and you could see the attempt at Indian influence. The seats convert to flatbed and best business class seat I have used. Service was fine - not refined but they provide pillows and blanket, pyjamas, great duvet, leather menu and landing card holder. Dinner service was great with choice of dessert, ice cream, chocolates, all delivered efficiently. Breakfast on the arrival to Australia was 'different' from a culinary point of view but very tasty. IFE was a bit limited but I use my iPad so not affected much."
837,"I traveled to Hong Kong from Delhi with my family,  there was a delay for 1.5 hours because some passengers from Mumbai had a connecting flight which was late, and therefore our flight was delayed. The cabin staff looked very casual and the food was not so good, and we didn't get any choice of meal in Business class. The return flight from Hong Kong was again on Boeing 787, but this time it was economy class. The seats were comfortable, but the staff service was really poor. I rang the service bell for several times but no one came to offer service. In the end I had to get up from my seat because I was really thirsty. Food on this flight was the worst I have had."
838,"We flew Air India from Bangkok to Milan via New Delhi. Onboard the pilot informed passengers about a software problem, but didn't say anything about leaving the plane. 10 minutes after people in front of us were starting to get off the plane so we thought was a good idea to follow them. Once back on the gate we sat, and no communication had been made to the speaker from that moment on. To know what was going on you had to chase the ground staff around the gate. After 2 hours of waiting a snack had been provided, but still no communication through the speaker, we just realized seeing people walking around with food. 3 hours after the schedule departure time, passengers flying to Rome and Milan had been told to not worry because the connection flight in Delhi was waiting for us. Landed in Delhi we ran to get the connection flight, but it left already since one hour, and we’ve got told that the plane wasn’t waiting for us at all. At this point we’ve been told that we had to sleep in the airport hotel and wait for next day flight. We asked for a free wi-fi connection to advise home about the delay and this was denied. Flying on Monday instead of Sunday we didn’t have anyone available for a pick up from Milan to where we live. After discussing with the lady in charge, she granted us, as sign of apologize, that someone from Air India staff will be sent to Milan Airport to pick us up and give us a lift to our homes. We landed in time to Milan on Monday night, and nobody was there waiting for us. We’ve been left alone on Monday night at the airport with no train or buses to catch till the next morning. During the night at the Airport hotel we’ve been denied access to our hold luggage, so we didn’t have access to clean clothes and personal bath items. Landed in Milan the luggage was missing. Delays can happen, missing a connection can happen, but I cannot stand to be left at the airport during the night, without a taxi service which had been granted from Air India staff."
839,"Air India was the worst airline I have ever flown. They cancelled our flights last minute. We had to cancel our forward flight as they changed the scheduled date. We had to go with another airline.  Return flight was also cancelled last minute. They asked us to go with Lufthansa to Frankfurt and then take Air India from there.  We chose Air India because it was cheaper, but we should have stuck to our regular airline. One bag didn't arrive, after many phone calls it arrived after 3 day. No customer service at all.  Lessons learnt."
840,"Air India flight from New York JFK to Delhi was probably the worst flight that I have taken in my entire life. It started prior to taking off. We were on the runway for about an hour and a half with no announcement from anyone on when we would be taking off. The AC apparently broke down so it was hot and uncomfortable. Finally the captain made an announcement about the AC and that we would be going back to the gate to get the situation fixed. Another hour later we were finally at the gate. Instead of letting us get out of the plane, we remained seated until they ""took care of the problem"". After another 45 minutes we were ready to go. Once we took off, it took less than 3 hours for the TV's to shutdown in certain areas of the plane. Along with that, none of the power plugs were working. I decided to ask one of the flight attendants if they can somehow find an empty seat for me to at least charge my laptop (there were tons of empty seats at the back of the plane, where the flight attendants were lounging). Of course without even getting up, she concluded that there was not any place for me to charge my laptop. Besides all of this, The flight attendants left a cart of snacks and water unattended in a galley for the passengers to help themselves with. I have never seen this before.  Passengers were all over, even with announcements to be seated. Flight attendants didn't bother checking for seats being upright and passengers being secured with belts. My food tray was broken. First and last time taking Air India!"
841,"I was not satisfied with Air India cabin crew who were unprofessional. I sat next to emergency exit door and nobody explained emergency escape procedures to me, and I pressed service light but no cabin crew answer for a long time until I walked to galley. I cannot understand why they don't serve a drink when they serviced meals. The IFE didn't have many choices. But the cost of Air India ticket was cheaper than other Star Alliance airlines and I can accumulate miles. I will choose Asiana Airlines next time if their cost is not expensive."
842,"London Heathrow to Bangalore return with Air India. I ordered continental vegetarian and non continental vegetarian for my son - they gave me Hindu meals, which I could not eat due to spicy. I told them in the airport at Bangalore long before return journey, but they still served the wrong order. The staff onboard were unconcerned. A male staff gave me a meat meal, and said just leave the meat. Next the gave me Chinese, plain insipid noodles. The cabin staff on outgoing journey were attentive, but not on return journey. Air India needs to be more accommodating to non Hindus as regards food and Western music."
843,"Air India got me to Chicago from Delhi on time but that's pretty much the good part. They messed up seat allocation, and chaos at checkin. Unnecessary airline security checks again after the airport security check. In cabin service was pretty poor - no enforcement of cabin safety during takeoff and landing, and the meal time management and keeping the lights in accordance with time zone of destination was terrible.  They serve a snack at 3am Delhi time, a breakfast 5 hours later when it's really dinner time in Chicago and then a lunch before landing at 5am Chicago time. The lunch was the only liquor service - 2 hours before landing at 7 am! The overhead reading lights did not work nor did the flight maps/camera. IFE very sluggish and oversensitive. Toilets became a mess mid flight. Avoid if you can fly another airline."
844,"Newark to Mumbai return, and very disappointing flights. Airplane old, entertainment is old, antiquated and in the case of mine and my son's seat, simply not working. Non-working entertainment for a 16-hour flight. After taking off and drink/food service, the cabin crew effectively vanished for 8 hours! Not one member to be seen walking the aisles, checking on their passengers, picking up the trash in the aisles.  Food was hastily shoved onto our trays : over-heated and nondescript. Confirmed Jain meal for my wife 3 times, but still not available once flight took off. Neat trick : Cabin crew says ""sorry"" - and they're immediately off the hook in terms of responsibility. Say you're sorry and the case is closed, whether you like it or not. Was not able to re-confirm my return trip with them without the intervention of a local travel agent. "
845,"Delhi to Mumbai with Air India. Check-in Experience was smooth since I arrived early for check-in of an early morning flight. Most of the counters were unmanned but there were very few travelers waiting to be checked in.  Boarding smooth because of light load on the flight, but staff seemed to be more interested in their own gossips. Onboard, a warm welcome by senior staff. Could not fault their service. Landing was smooth but a long taxi to reach the new terminal and further delay due to remote stand and heavy rains meant that it took 40 min to enter the terminal after landing. Baggage delivery was slow and disorganized. Took 1 hour for first bag to be delivered after landing. Staff were nowhere to be found to give any updates. Not so happy ending to otherwise good experience."
846,"Air India Delhi to Singapore flight AI380 flight was cancelled at the last minute citing 'crew shortage', after half the people were checked-in. Total chaos. This is a regular feature for DEL-SIN route, previous cancellation a week back. No other option than to wait for the next day flight. Avoid this airline."
847,"I flew with my wife and 2 kids on Air India Boeing 777. My family and several other passengers did not have a working entertainment system throughout the 16 hour flight. On top this our seats were not comfortable and did not recline sufficiently for a decent sleep. We brought the IFE issue to one flight attendants attention, he said he did not manufacture the entertainment system so he was not responsible. He came up with several rude comments rather than solving the issue."
848,"Air India from FRA-DEL in business class. The ground staff in Frankfurt couldn't issue a boarding pass for my connecting flight in India (DEL-HYD), due to some technical issue. I absolutely understand that, not their fault. But the lady at the check in counter was rude. There was no priority boarding. The aircraft was clean and seat was comfortable. Was offered a pair of pyjamas. Very good choice of food and drinks. The on board staff was excellent and attentive , a very pleasant surprise after the experience on the ground. "
849,"We took Air India from Chennai to Paris via Delhi. The first flight was on an A320, early morning departure, flight was on-time, good clean flight, breakfast was served. FA's were attentive, IFE was basic with just a few channels. Delhi to Paris was on brand new B787 Dreamliner, excellent flight, on-time arrival in Paris. Lunch and snack was served with choice of Indian and continental. FA's were young and answered the call button that my kids pressed a few times. IFE was better and had good selection of latest Hollywood movies. The best thing I would say is the seat pitch at 33 inches, good leg room. AI product has improved and you can notice they are responsive."
850,"I would personally not recommend this airline. Really bad customer service at Delhi airport. Once in air, service appalling and the food was bad."
851,"On the outbound journey LHR-DEL-BKK we wondered what the bad reviews were all about with good service and edible food albeit the standard curry or vegetarian on offer and a good selection of drinks available, however on the return flight the true horrors of this airline materialised. Breakfast, frozen melon and cold omelette with 2 frankfurters plus something in the corner of the dish which I have no idea what it was. Lunch, frozen curry, frozen salad and an ice cold bread roll, really appetising to say the least. The cabin crew warmed the meal up twice but it was still frozen. The plus side if there was one was the cost of the flight, saved us almost a £1000 on the 4 tickets in total so I think the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" sums up Air India. "
852,"Air India maintained timely performance on all my segments. Beyond that, everything is downhill. Air India crew keeps their luggage on the First Class overhead bin. There was no room for me to place my hand luggage. Air India staff (head inflight attendant) told me to go keep it somewhere else or just leave it on the floor! Note: this is the response for a First Class Passenger! Meals were not served in First Class (at least the breakfast). No one came and spoke to you or welcomed you. If meals were served on-demand, on should let the passenger know - right? It was different when checking in though - staff escorted you to the lounge. For some reason, food items that need to be cold (cheese especially) were all in room temperature - not sure why and was not appealing to the taste buds. Food presentation was horrible. Inconsistent service and very chaotic inside the plane throughout the flight. There was no orderliness. Air India is cutting costs and one can tell. Entertainment sucks - especially the TV quality. Inflight map did not work. Looking at flight attendants and their attitude one wonders how they would cope in emergencies. I will not fly them again."
853,"Check in quick, Fast track security pass and invitation to no 1 lounge at Birmingham. Lounge nothing special but it was a quiet space to sit. On boarding champagne offered and magazines and sorts of impeccable. Food was nice. My two young kids were with me on way back (3 and 5) and enjoyed it. Smoothies served on way back. Seats can be set to how you want in between sitting and lying nearly flat. I was worried about going air India but I wouldn't hesitate to go again because it's the only flight from Birmingham to Delhi direct. Service was excellent cabin is quiet and private (only 3 passengers going, 5 on way back). I also went Delhi to Calcutta business class on Boeing 777, and the cabin was tired. Returning from Calcutta business was full so I had to fly economy. Oh my god, I know what people here are talking about. It was horrible. Staff are not interested in anything. I just wanted it to be over. Cramped, full to the brim, food not nice. If your thinking of flying economy on Air India, you should probably switch to airline such as Singapore Airlines etc. if your going business, well depends how much your paying on our route it pretty competitive and the only direct flight."
854,"I flew Air India while returning from Chicago, a direct connection from Chicago O'Hare Intl. Airport to Delhi Indira Gandhi International. Check-in wasn't very smooth, my carry-on was a couple of kilos over 7, and I was asked to transfer some of my stuff to my check-in, and I obliged. For several years I have travelled Air India, this was the first time my carry-on was checked for weight, but this is a welcome change that ultimately makes it so much more convenient for all the passengers. After boarding, we were kept waiting for the flight to take off, and were later informed that due to a technical snag, there would be a delay. Finally, after a delay of almost two hours, we took off for our destination. Air India have deteriorated in terms of food quality in the past couple of years, and I had little expectations from the in-flight meal. The food was bland, a spinach-based curry which tasted awful, and their signature bad bread. The IFE didn't have a lot of options, but the interface itself was okay. The headphones were sub-standard and not up to the mark. This was a big disappointment, considering that it's a long-haul flight lasting just a little under 15 hours. Service was okay-ish, the stewardesses just seemed to be doing their jobs. I felt there was a need for them to brush up their spoken-English, announcements were being made in poor English. Minor problem, but something that can be worked on. The cabin itself was good, the lavatories were surprisingly clean, and the seats were quite comfortable. Apart from the food and IFE, the journey itself was quite pleasing and 15 hours passed quickly. Although Air India is not right up there with the likes of Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines, it is a pretty decent option on the ORD-DEL route. "
855,"Air India is the worst airline I have experienced in years, would never book this airline again. Don't trust the customer care details, they don't know about the information they are giving. Web check in is one of the hopeless part, they change your seats randomly without you noticing. Don't be attracted due to a bit less air fare, better to pay more and opt for other airlines. Inexperienced staff and customer care."
856,"The problems began with boarding. The message displayed was 'Final Call' but when we got to the gate, they hadn't even began boarding. A few confused passengers, breathless from running the length of the terminal, actually asked if this was the right gate. Why give wrong information to the passengers? This is a new plane and route introduced by Air India this year but the state of the plane was abysmal. The carpets had stains and the seats looked like they had been in use for many years. I expect some wear and tear but  they have to do a better job with the upkeep. The cabin service was the worst I have ever experienced in a plane. Refreshments were not offered after take-off. The cabin crew couldn't care less about the safety of the passengers because they didn't do a double check on the safety belts, and no restrictions on electronic devices were imposed. It seemed to me that the attendants on my flight took every opportunity to sit and rest when the rest of us had empty trays sitting out. About 2 hours into the flight, I needed a glass of water. I pressed the Call button and waited for about 30 minutes. I was not the only one. I saw a lot of lights lit up in our section - no refreshments were offered. To my surprise, the attendant went to the small control screen near the exit door and turned off all the call lights! Nobody bothered to check on any of the passengers. Irate, I went up front and confronted one of the attendants. She said, point blank, that she was taking care of 'other things.' Was she flying the plane? I don't understand this level of indifference to your job. They definitely need more training. And this is the national carrier of India!  I would not fly this airlines again unless I am really strapped for cash."
857,"I flew from Milan to Cochin via Delhi last week. The Flight was delayed 2 hours 45 minutes which was notified by the airline earlier that day. Dinner was served very quickly after take off and then passengers went to sleep. 4-5 hours later breakfast was served which was okay. I wanted to purchase some duty free products on board and I had to call the cabin crew, no one responded for nearly an hour, I found them chatting with their colleagues and when I asked for the duty free brochure list I was told, ""Sorry Sir, we are going to land in 45 minutes and the duty free shop is closed"". I was disappointed with their reply and had to return to my seat. The overall experience was below average for an Intercontinental flight. "
858,"Very often you see an airline getting knocked down for poor service, and this makes it more worthwhile being in a position to write a positive report. AI's fare was lowest among the full service carriers and offered a pretty reasonable connecting time to Goa, India. It is for this reason that AI becomes my primary choice, and then I compare the service. Flight left on time, the service was friendly with many smiles, seats comfortable, clean cabin (don't know about the toilets), drinks followed by dinner was better than average, water offered every hour or so during the flight. The only negative is that the movies were dated - but I was okay with a re-run of Batman, which just about put me to sleep. The second leg BOM-GOI was about 50 mins, also on time, with a sandwich and packaged juice. and mediocre entertainment (didn't matter)."
859,"AI 214, 4th Aug - Did not have high expectations from this airline and they did not disappoint. The plane was newish and seats came with good legroom. The flight manager was rude. Food was pastry and some indian sweets, no drinks offered besides water whislt Nepal Airlines serve a full meal and drink service on this sector. They kept mentioning being a Star Alliance member but never acknowledged passengers with Gold membership."
860,"Legroom comfortable, cabin very quiet and LED lighting gives a great feel. Charging and USB socket on every seat very helpful. The crew were smiling and courteous, and food extremely good. Best service to date with Air India, except for the immigrations and customs in Delhi which could be done directly in Bangalore."
861,"The positives: The Dreamliner is an excellent and new aircraft and for once everything on it worked and was clean and well maintained. The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations. Not on par as Singapore, Emirates and Asian carriers but solidly good overall."
862,Flight of 9 hours from Delhi to London on 777-300 series. Managed to book seat 42 which is an aisle seat in line of 3 with no seat in front of it. Great leg room plus middle seat next to me was empty. 2 meals offered plus drinks and flight was on time. Crew worked hard at offering water and juice during flight and arrived in London dead on time.
863,Evening flight from Heathrow on Air India 777-300 to Delhi. Left on time and arrived slightly early 2 meals offered plus drink service. Plenty of time to sleep and arrive refreshed at lunchtime Delhi time Again managed to book seat 42 with no seat in front but did move in flight to an empty row of 3 which allowed some better sleep. Crew excellent as have been previous flights on Air India
864,Air India Dreamliner from Delhi to Melbourne pulled away from the gate on time but during taxi returned back to a different gate due to a technical issue. Took 1.5 hours to fix during which time lunch and drinks service was offered. Once fault repaired flight underway almost 2 hours late. Little time made up of passage to Melbourne so arrived about 1.5 hours late which did squeeze connections from Melbourne. Air India had rebooked passengers who missed their connections and this was communicated on arrival as to new flight details Flight was comfortable with 2 meals plus snack and drinks offered. Crew again work hard keeping passengers comfortable and well hydrated. This was 4th Air India flight in space of a month and have to say was impressed in the offering. Would definitely fly them again if offered.
865,"Flew Air India Dreamliner from Melbourne to Delhi. Plane very comfortable seating arrangements good with plenty of space even for me at 6’4”, it was a day flight and 2 meals and a snack pack supplied on the journey of 12 hours which was a surprise. Meal choice of Indian veg or meat plus European choice of chicken with pasta. Drinks also offered each service. Crew offered plenty of water or juice throughout the flight and snacks and drinks available in the galley if required. Restrooms kept clean during flight. If there was a downside of Air India perhaps the in flight entertainment is a little limited but was adequate for the flight."
866,"The quality of the airline has deteriorated badly. My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with prior intimation which was fine. I reached DEL at the eleventh hour when the boarding for PAR had already begun. I met the worst ground staff at DEL airport who don't even know how to behave with a passenger and behave as if doing a big favour. I was not attended by any transit desk people and when contacted the AI staff asked me to run behind people on transit to other destinations that was just so cheap. Next thing was the annoying security check which took nearly 30 minutes with a quick immigration for transit passengers. The flight was quite empty and quite comfortable, with friendly cabin crew. But the flight was mostly full of foreigners and the announcement was missing in French and the really fast Indian English was really sad for the French people who kept asking me to translate what they meant. Arrival in Paris was very smooth. I wouldn't mind flying with AI but I would never ever fly via DEL airport again in my life except for my return flight and I would not mind shelling out some extra chunks for this matter. The ticket was the cheapest even at the last minute."
867,"The flight AI301 scheduled at 7am of 14th May never left Melbourne because of an engine problem. They rescheduled us on a 2pm Thai flight on route Melbourne-Bangkok-Delhi. I got to Delhi at 3am instead of 6pm, when I booked the tickets through the Melbourne office they guaranteed me the transit hotel because my connection was more than 17 hours. When I got to Delhi a rude company attendant told me that they don't give this kind of service so I spent more than 10 hours on the airport. No way to speak with someone from the company during all this time. Air India never again - saved $300 compare with Emirates but a big mistake. Complain to the company and still waiting for an answer."
868,Flight was half empty. Crew were cordial and food was served immediately. The light-changing windows were slightly annoying. Prefer Jet for short-haul and domestic routes.
869,"I read some bad reviews but it was mentioned the 787 was better. Not so in my case. I had an aisle seat. The seat reclining feature didn't work. I was forced to sit upright for the whole red eye flight of over 8 hours. The light switch on the remote didn't work so I couldn't even read. The lady in the window seat also had trouble with her seat. The food was not that great. The cabin staff were fine but not anything special like Emirates. About two hours after take off the cabin and lavatories were trashed. Safety was never an issue. All in all, I will avoid Air India, at least until I see some better reviews."
870,"LHR-ATQ via DEL in Business Class. Check in was a bit busy but we were checked in quick and given our boarding passes for all onwards flights. But we found out at check in that we would have to re-check our bags in at DEL. Air India lounge at LHR is very nice. Good choices of canapés and drinks. Boarding was a complete disaster, there was no separate queue for Business or First class passengers. Boarding drinks with a choice of orange juice or Champagne. Food was not the greatest and the seats were old. Landed in DEL ontime and had to re-check our bags in which was alright because, they have separate queues here. The lounge at DEL was very quiet and we were the only people in the lounge for a while. DEL-ATQ sector had a 2 hour delay because, but on the upside we were upgraded from Business to First which was a surprise. On this short flight we only got served nuts and drinks."
871,"The service was adequate and friendly. Meal choice - Chicken/Fish/Vegetarian on the outgoing flight and kebabs as a big snack for the incoming overnight flight. In all a good return trip between Singapore and Goa via Mumbai. With this level of service, punctuality, leg room and price Air India is a good option. The negatives - I ordered a special (DBML) meal on the return flight but did not get it. Also Air India's online check-in has a glitch - I've faced this problem five times in the past (out of five attempts). The problem - at the end of the online check-in screens after entering passport and visa details, the system flashes an error message. At the airport staff struggle to rectify the error and have to consult manuals/supervisors etc. On the last occasion I tied up one check in counter for 20 minutes while they tried rectifying this problem."
872,"On both sectors shabby aircraft interiors. The general appearance of the staff specially on the return flight was appalling. The grooming standards were low. The stewardess greeting customers in the aisle was leaning on a seat head rest with her hands on her chin and yawning - not the image that Air India wants to portray. The whole service and meal tray could be better. Their website is good and easy to use, the call centre staff are very polite and efficient - the airport in Delhi is a delight."
873,"DEL-LHR - Experience was overall satisfactory, within 20 minutes we reached cruising altitude and immediately snacks and drinks were served. I must say the flight steward looked dazed and did not look motivated. After serving food (very average), our plates were collected and cabin lights were immediately turned off. I did notice a few people wandering around the cabin, looking for a bite to eat and water/drinks. I was able to sleep well. Flight was on time, landed around 10 mins late into Heathrow. LHR-DEL - Experience was again a let down. To begin with we were 4.5 hours late, though we were informed well in advance. We finally boarded the aircraft and the first images of worn out carpets and shabby seat upholstery made the already disgruntled passengers more upset. Food was served very fast and lights were switched off! A couple of hours into our flight I got up to get a glass of water, I asked the air hostesses sitting at the back and they simply pointed their finger at a water dispenser, which I personally found very unprofessional. The experience at new Delhi T3 was a mood changer (for the good)!"
874,"United flight was cancelled so I had to jump to AI. Flew first class and got first class treatment. Personal guide to walk me thru immigration, skip the lines and to the lounge. The lounge is excellent in Mumbai, business and the separate FC lounge. Onboard, seats are private. Service excellent and food is impressive. I have marked down for seat comfort - they lie flat but the cushion padding is poor and the seat is not comfortable. I also take a star off for movie selection - too few movies and too old. For a 15 hour flight I expect several top movies and new movies.  As a final note the new Mumbai airport, international are is impressive."
875,"Flew Chicago to Delhi, business class, June 6 2015. Unlike most of my experience on other flights with Air India the crew disappeared after they served drinks and food. Just no service. On most other Airlines its common to see the crew walking with drinks every 15 mins or so. Well Air India did not think that's necessary. Food is average. Crew do not even bother to check if the amenities in the toilets are there. 
"
876,"Flew DEL-ORD and back. Poorly maintained aircraft B777. Worn out seats. Cleanliness sub-optimal both for the cabin and in the lavatories. Staff only does the process of rushing through meal service thrice during the 15 hour flight and switch off lights rest of the time - unlike some of the good East Asian airlines, there is no one regularly going through the cabin to see if passengers need anything. One can always go back and ask for tea/coffee. There is water/juices kept in the aisle but they really don't come back to see if replenishments are needed. In-flight entertainment inadequate for such a long flight. Flight path either not switched on in time or grossly inaccurate. Safety vests hanging out from below most seats. Food quality and quantity both average. On the forward flight, the salad was spoilt and I had to return it. Only good thing is the cost - I had purchased a hugely discounted ticket - cost far less than what was available on other airlines."
877,I was returning from a business trip in India and was booked onto air India flights. The first leg I flew business class on an A321. This was sub standard for business. The food was poor and the aircraft was very tired and dated. On checking in for this flight the staff were rude and displayed a distinct lack of awareness of time when checking in a large group. They refused to let us use the other business class desks for check in and this resulted in the plane being delayed. Our connection through Delhi was rushed because of this delay with us having to run through the airport. The 777 flight to LHR was outrageous. The staff were not at all attentive the food was inedible and seats uncomfortable. The in flight entertainment was of a low standard for a national airline. Business class was empty and they wouldn't move people who's entertainment was not working.
878,I missed my connecting flight of British Airways from London Heathrow to Mumbai as my first flight of American Airlines was delayed by 2 hours. So I was put on Air India flight 130. It was delayed by 5 hours. But on boarding I just was amazed to sit in the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. I like the in-flight entertainment the seat legroom was more than enough and yes the cabin interior was pretty colorful. The food was good enough even though a bit spicy but better than what was on American Airlines. The crew were also polite. Overall experience was pretty good. All Air India needs to do is keep a tab on delays and make sure they continue this trend on other flights as well. I would surely recommend this airline especially the Dreamliner.
879,8th May 2015 AI 603. BOM-Bangalore Executive Class. Comfortable seats savoury meal clean cabin - though signs of ageing visible and courteous staff. Overall a pleasant experience.
880,"BOM-DEL-FRA: Both sectors were operated by 787 Dreamliner. BOM-DEL was early morning flight so they served breakfast which was warm good and filling. On the both the sectors I noticed that cabin crew are quite different. Either one is polite and second is just ""veg"" or ""non-veg"". I am sorry but we are not sitting at a street side cafe. Air India is the flag carrier of India and the crew should understand very well that they are representing our country on foreign land. DEL-FRA sector was delayed by 50 mins but crew member on my row was very polite and welcoming. Cabin crew on other side of row was just disinterested and rude. As I have said before (see below) crew does lack inter-personal skills and need professional training. It was like flying two different airlines being in same aircraft. Cabins need to be regularly cleaned. Toilets should be in perfect condition. Food quality needs to be urgently improved. Captain needs training to interact with passengers on regular period. Its high time AVOD has to be upgraded. AI has to learn a lot all of this from thier own partners TK LH and SQ."
881,"FRA-DEL-BOM: Travelling with AI 2nd time within 3 months and I notice that the staff members are particularly lethargic and disinterested on FRA-DEL sector. Due to LH strike flight was completely booked out and ""old"" crew members of AI couldn't really handle this full flight though I have noticed that younger crew are willing and accommodating. In general crew highly lacks inter-personal skills and are strongly recommended to go through professional training. Another point where AI needs to be stringent is on cleanliness of the aircraft. These Dreamliners are only 2 years old and they are in appalling condition. Washroom glass broken and stuck with cello- tape. Luggage marks on overhead cabins cookie crumbs in seat pocket seat broken and handle is hanging. AVOD has very limited choice and urgently needs to upograde it. Indian food has won several accords world-wide and Air India is doing such injustice to Indian cuisine. They should learn from TK about it. AI needs to revamp its image in order to gain market or else they keep loosing. Next time I will fly with Jet or Turkish."
882,I flew from Ottawa via Montreal via Zurich to New Delhi then onwards to Calcutta. The flight from New Delhi to Calcutta was a total nightmare and I really don't recommend anyone flying with Air India at all. Flight was supposed to leave in the morning but didn't leave until 11.45 am. Staff unprofessional and didn't make this flight pleasant. Inflight entertainment in limited but you should bring your own IPad to watch movies music etc. Never again Air India.
883,Flight from KIX-HKG in Business Class. Although I found the lounge access at KIX mediocre which is shared with Cathay Pacific the Business Class product aboard the Dreamliner with AI is comparable or exceeds standards I have had with other carriers. There were three different meal selections on that flight (the curried chicken I had was delicious) and the seat/lie flat bed was very comfortable. Be careful not to place your mobile on the bottom armrest as there is a gap and it was difficult to retrieve when I reclined and it fell between. The entertainment system was excellent with a wide variety of films and television series. Overall I was very impressed with the service and it's much improved compared to when I last flew AI eight years ago.
884,We had three domestic flights in April 2015 (DEL-UDR-BOM-GOI) all on A319 aircraft. The aircraft interior was quite filthy on all flights. The food and drink service was ok on all flights. However the cabin crew did not pay attention to any safety related issues on any of those flights. Seats were reclined during take off and landing by a lot of passengers little kids were running over their parents laps from across seat rows during take off and cabin crew did not offer belt extensions for securing infants. Air India needs to work on their staff attitude towards safety.
885,"Flew from Heathrow to Delhi in April this year. Cabin staff lack Professionalism. They hardly smile and seem frustrated as they have to serve passengers. There is no sense of customer service. Saw the crew sleeping during the flight instead of serving the passengers. The only question they ask ""veg or non veg"" without any ""Please"". Air India has to improve service to get competitive. The food was horrible. The toilets were disgraceful. The entertainment systems are broken and slow. Finally Air-India captains and crew need to polish up communication skills over the intercom as they have difficulty both in English and Hindi. Yes I still fly Air-India."
886,Flight from ICN to HKG. 12 hour delay. But hotel provided. The 787 was a wonderful aircraft with plenty of legroom. Unfriendly cabin crew they never smiled and they seemed tired.
887,I recently flew DEL-SYD on a 2.5 year old 787. It was in appalling condition. The aircraft was filthy. Many parts of the bathroom were held together with tape. Service was rude when rarely present. Overall a very poor experience.
888,AI 570/571 BOM-MAA-BOM: Booked on airindia.com convenient allows seat selection. Checked in on the web as well without much trouble which allows you to go straight to the security check if you only have a carry-on bag. 570 was a relatively new 319 with good seats and pitch but 571 was an old 320 uncomfortable seating and lighting and very noisy in the front cabin until it had climbed up to cruise altitude. Standard Air India service - decent meals efficient no small talk no cheer. Both flights were nearly on time but a delay of 5-10 minutes in getting a bus to ferry us to the terminal at MAA.
889,AI 933 flight from COK-SHJ on 29/03/2015. We were made to wait for 16 hrs in the airport with them changing the time every two hours and eventually told us the flight was cancelled. After a 16 hr delay they decided to shift the passengers to hotels. Food was not provided. The duty manager refused to attend the problems. Poor quality of communication. Planning not to fly Air India anymore.
890,We travelled Air India business class in December 2014 and recently from London to Mumbai and Delhi to London. We found the plane modern and clean and the crew were delightful. The reviews we read did not resemble our experience and as regular business class passengers on other airlines we were very happy with the experience. The only critique was that the food was a bit limited and not as proficient as other airlines. The seats were spacious and the flat beds very comfortable and we will definitely be using this airline again.
891,Chose Air India as it was the best schedule and best fare for non-stop service JFK-Delhi on B777. Using their website for anything but purchases and seat selection was a waste of time. Endless circles asking and re-asking for information. Calling their help center was also somewhat futile due to language issues and lack of proper training. Our outbound flight was delayed 5 hours but the airline did call and text with the news. So that was decent of them but no apology for the delay and we lost half a day in India. Seats had uncomfortable cushions and were tightly spaced. Luckily the flight was quite empty so most people had 2 or 3 seats to themselves outbound. In-flight AVOD could be good but the touch screens were not working so well and the hand held device was worthless. Flight back was delayed by nearly an hour due to late arrival. Same uncomfortable seats and slow touch screens. Service both ways was efficient limited and far from gracious. Announcements were few. All in all it was a very average flight with below average service. The only reason to use them is the low cost.
892,"Avoid Air India at all costs. The ""Business Class"" was anything but the seats were incredibly uncomfortable and you sit 4"" from the person next to you! There is no room to do work or anything else comfortably. The service was the worst I've had and the food was just as bad. These are very old aircraft and between the seats carpets and disgusting galley the old age shows! The inflight 'entertainment system' is vintage 1980's and the screens are effectively not usable."
893,I flew AI from Newark to Mumbai and it was 100% better than my flight on United. Seats were much comfortable and spacious than other airlines. AI144 was right on time from Newark and I didn't know its a Star Alliance member. I landed 30 mins before schedule to Mumbai and liked the food ambiance and service on board. Many people have wrong perceptions about AI but hope it improves its PR department.
894,The second occasion I have flown with Air India and I must say it was appalling. Whilst my international flight from BHX to DEL was on time as scheduled my connecting (domestic) flight was 2 hours late due to Air India wanting to fill planes before they depart. This happened on one occasion however due to my family members travelling on the same flight on different dates within the space of two weeks they also experienced the same delays for again no apparent reason. There is no communication from the airline and there is no concept of customer service. I experienced further problems on my return flight from ATQ to BHX on 15/3/15. My domestic flight from ATQ to DEL was fine on time and a pleasant flight all to become disastrous on my arrival to DEL at 11.20am. We (ATQ passengers to BHX) were left on board the plane as the plane was to continue on the BHX. The flight was due to leave at 13.15pm however this was delayed by over 2 hours apparently due to a missing manual which it was apparently unsafe to fly without. My family and I were left sitting on a plane for over five hours with no communication food and general ability to move around. On asking flight attendants for information and food both requests were denied. Bigger doesn't not mean better and this was most certainly the case with Air India. I feel Air India clearly do not see any problems with delaying travellers flights and breaking UK consumer laws by providing misleading information to customers.
895,I booked a return trip from Delhi to Kochi two months in advance. When I arrived at the airport my flight simply did not exist. I queued for forty minutes at the 'Help' desk where I explained that I had booked on a flight at 13.30. The man laughed at me and told me that flight was full so I had been moved to one at 18.05. I asked how that could be when I had a ticket for the 13.30 flight and yet it wasn't showing on the board. He then said that there was no 13.30 flight and that there wasn't nothing he could do. I was looking at eight hours in Delhi airport. No apology no explanation. I then asked where the left luggage store was that is advertised on the airport website. He told me it did not exist. Staff insisted that I would have to check the bag at a cost of 30000 Rupees (£300). All staff were unhelpful and rude. Eventually a guy working at the suitcase wrapping stand told me where to find the left luggage store which is in the Metro station. I checked my suitcase for a week for 3500R - £35). Flight was delayed by another two hours - I arrived in Kochi at 1am and missed the beginning of my organised tour. Return flight was just the same - arrive at the airport flight doesn't exist. Not just my flight - lots of passengers had booked on earlier flights but simply been moved. My plane should have left at 4pm giving me lots of time for my connection at 3.40am. We were still sitting at the gate in Kochi at 10.45pm. We only got on the plane after there was a near riot and passengers insisted that the plane not be cleaned but that we should just be allowed to board. I was too late to make my connection back to London. At no point at all did I receive anything like an apology or explanation. This just seems to be how they do business. Never again.
896,Flew PVG-DEL return (and Delhi to Kochi return) in economy. Flight from Shanghai was very smooth super empty Dreamliner left on time very comfortable. The Delhi to Kochi flight was very delayed but otherwise fine. The DEL-PVG leg was a disaster. We took off on time and made very good time there was a storm over Shanghai so we circled twice before landing at an airport about two hours away. Totally understandable these things happen. But we were then held on the tarmac for more than 4 hours with no water and with two of the bathrooms out of order. We got very little information and crew did not push for our release. I understand the Chinese ground staff just didn't come but Air India has to fight for its passengers rights - more than 4 hours with no food or water! We could not use the bathroom! The plane was beginning to smell. This was so poorly handled and has really put me off Air India.
897,I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again.
898,Chicago (ORD) to Delhi (DEL). February 2015. I booked ticket on website and went to the airport with check-in and carry-on bag. I got a surprise at the counter the person told that I can carry only 4 Kg carry-on baggage. This was unexpected. Finally moved some luggage from one bag to other on airport and took receipts of the bag. Onboard: The crew served snacks and water but I needed more water I was searching for crew but couldn't find them. The crew returned after some time and served more food and drinks. On a 14 hours non-stop flight this should be their practice. Food was good - in taste and quantity. Entertainment was okay. Seat was comfortable with enough legroom a very important thing for 14hr non stop flight. What didn't work: 1 or 2 restrooms ran out of tissues towards the end of the journey. Though it was a long journey crew should have done something to improve this. Overall: Apart from the restroom issue I didn't feel that anything went wrong. Overall flight was a very good experience with plenty of foods drinks good seating okay entertainment.
899,Flew from Heathrow to Amritsar in January this year. First they cancelled my 1.15pm flight due to bad weather in Delhi however the connecting flight from Delhi to Amritsar was still going ahead! What about the bad weather in Delhi? I was put on an evening flight the same day. Landed in Delhi at 11.50 am and my connecting flight was now scheduled for 7.30pm. Had I been put on my previous flight I would have landed in time to catch my connecting flight to Amritsar. The flight was again delayed by 3 hours and no explanation was given to us. I have heard that the airline overbooks the seats. Cabin staff don't bother when you ask them for a coffee instead of tea. I asked them for water twice but still didn't get any. They hardly smile and seem very frustrated. We vow never to fly Air India again!
900,"Flew DEL-BOM-DEL on A321 both ways (AI865 and AI888) and was very happy with the AI experience: flights on time cabins relatively clean with the IFE working good hot meals provided both ways and - contrary to some previous reviews - the cabin crews were very good. On BOM-DEL sector we loved the chicken and after telling this to a female flight attendant she soon came back with more chicken and was very happy to serve us more. Absolutely delightful! However the ""signature coffee"" on AI remains very weak year after year but all the rest was excellent on these two domestic flights. Maybe the competition on this trunk route including the new Vistara Airlines keeps Air India alert and they have to put some extra effort to keep their loyal customers coming back."
901,"AI984 GOI-BOM 9 March and AI342 BOM-SIN on 10 March. Check in was quick as I had arrived at the airport early. Both flights left on time. The first flight was short and uneventful/unremarkable. The crew on the second flight were friendly and helpful responding to passengers with a genuinely caring attitude. Meals served and cleared quickly enabling passengers to get some shut eye on this overnight flight. Kebabs served with cut fruit and dessert for the midnight ""snack"". All in all a good experience."
902,Traveled on TRV-SHJ sector during January 2015. The aircraft operated was an Airbus A320. Check in was smooth and hassle free. The inbound aircraft was delayed from MAA (as its a MAA-TRV-SHJ flight) and the departure hence got delayed for around 45 minutes. Frisking by Air India group security was done prior to boarding. The interior seats were comfortable and clean. The attitude of the cabin crew as usually complained was poor. One of the aged crew was serving food even without asking whether non-veg or veg. Few of the passengers including myself had to ask her to change as she simply gave the non veg without asking.It seemed they ran out of veg meals. Flight managed to land 30 minutes late at Sharjah and the baggage delivery was prompt as well. Overall experience was good.
903,"My group flew from Chicago to Delhi on 2/20 and from Delhi to Chicago 2/28. Absolutely the worst experience we have had on an airplane. We never saw the fight crew except when they served hot meals and a drink before the meal on a 14 hour flight. This was the only contact we had with the crew. We actually saw the crew sleeping during the flight instead of serving the customers. The crew never came around and offered drinks or snacks however drinks and peanuts and sandwiches were at the service stations and we basically served ourselves. Never have we seen or experienced such a thing. The entertainment was pretty good however many of us in our group had consoles that didn't work and remotes were not functioning either. The bathrooms ran out of paper and the cleanliness got worse as the flight continued. After 14 hours you can imagine the results of a lack of hand towels and toilet paper in an airplane. Basically there was no such thing as cleanliness. Let's talk about the seats. Where we sat was like a rock! The bottom was hard and the back you could actually feel the frame. Numbness was a way of life for 14 hours. Eventually we got creative and figured a way to make our seats ""comfortable"". Some used their pillows from home for their back others used the pillow and/or the blanket from the airline for cushioning. Basically these seats were the worst!"
904,LHR to MEL via DEL and return on deeply discounted ticket. Flight from New Delhi to Melbourne delayed in 1 hour increments with no final departure time given. Air India ground staff had no idea when the flight would eventually leave and weren't bothered about it either. After about 5 hours in an attempt to force Air India respond to the situation the other passengers began physically preventing the one remaining ground staff at the gate from leaving and then blockading the other Air India gates in the terminal to prevent boarding. By this tactic several other flights were delayed amid lots of shouting and chanting of slogans. Eventually a crew was taken off a Hong Kong flight to operate the one to Melbourne and we departed 9.5 hours late. The on-board service was mediocre and the IFE not fully functional on two flights. The seats folded into a horizontal flat bed (B787 aircraft) and were quite comfortable. Given the delay in New Delhi and the manner in which it was handled there is no way this airline can be recommended no matter what the ticket price.
905,"FRA-DEL/DEL-KAT/KAT-DEL-FRA - Were told at check-in in FRA that there was a delay of 1 hour but gate was closed at scheduled time! Waiting time of one full hour in FRA before taking off! No service or drinks for 4 hours during flight. Breakfast served last minute. Crew on all legs not really interested in customer and service. Dreamliner with lot of space and good fresh air full flat beds really comfortable. Food ok but cheese platter served after dessert. Champagne before taking off but no wine offered on return-flight. Flight to Kathmandu and back: time change and delayed return for 1.5 hrs. Service pathetic no smile the only question was ""veg or non veg"" without any ""please"". Air India has to improve service to get competitive."
906,Flew Chennai-Mumbai. Aircraft was an old A-319 still sporting the old Indian colors. Faded but clean interiors. Energetic cabin crew. Hot meal served on board. They ran out non-veg selection after a while and when queried by one of the passengers the answer given was that they had loaded more veg meals with the assumption that not many people would take non-veg on a Thu. Overall Air India is a cheap option to fly from point to point if one is not bothered about in-flight service and entertainment.
907,LHR to SYD via Delhi. Three legs in 687 and final leg in 777. Generally satisfactory but much room for improvement. Lie flat seats on all flights. Cabin crew good. All flights late on take off and landing which seems common with AI. Catering standards poor compared with competitors and lacks consistency. Overall flights satisfactory given the low price but AI need to improve to compare with better airlines.
908,LHR to Melbourne via Delhi. Flights were on time. Comfortable flat beds and attentive service especially on the Delhi to Melbourne leg (crew were a bit less energetic on the first leg). Food was fine. I liked the rather retro cocktail trolley before dinner. Air India is not up there with the very best and there are far fewer frills (no real amenity kit at all and food presentation isn't so polished). But the fare was also a lot less I had a flat bed all the way to Australia and the crew on the second leg were really trying hard and were very sweet. I have no complaints.
909,Chennai-Dubai and Dubai-Mumbai a couple of months ago. Old A-321 aircraft with faded seats and no inflight entertainment system. Surly cabin crew who had a feeling that they were doing a favor to passengers. On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation. With this kind of flight experience it is no wonder that most of the traffic on the Gulf routes from India deviates towards the Middle Eastern carriers.
910,Flew AI 381 (787 Dreamliner) SIN - DEL on 25 Dec 14 the brand new dreamliner was excellent with flat bed seats crew were polite and attentive breakfast served on board was excellent. Air India should enhance their inflight entertainment system with more options of latest movies in it I would definitely recommend and use Air India again in future.
911,Flight 8763 27th December. Flew Munich-Delhi in December in a Dreamliner. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of AI. Very efficient staff and overall quality for money.
912,AI143 from CDG to DEL. Departure on time. 787 service with IFE in economy although with limited choice. Choice of 3 entrees (Fish Chicken Vegetarian). Nice and very efficient cabin crew. Overall a good night flight.
913,"Flew DEL-BOM-GOI-MAA-DEL on 4th and 8th January 2015. DEL-BOM-GOI was the best of the lot with great food and on- time performance. Return journey was pretty pathetic as our flight from GOI got delayed due to ""technical"" failures which the check-in personnel were reluctant to tell about. Missed our return connection from MAA in the morning but the airline was kind enough to rebook us in an evening flight and gave vouchers for lunch given by some cold faces in the airport. MAA-DEL was delayed due to weather in DEL. The only flipside in all the three journeys was the basic IFE and some tasteless food in GOI-MAA and MAA-DEL flights. Crews were decent and had served with smile though."
914,AI 675 Mumbai - Kolkata on 17th January 2015. The aircraft an A320 was in excellent condition. It was spotless and the seats were very clean and so was the entire cabin. The crew were excellent always smiling and helping the guests. The seats provided extreme comfort with ample leg space. The only suggestion that comes to my mind is AI should make sure that they change the menu because the last time I flew AI 675 in Nov' 2014 the same breakfast was served (Non Veg). The flight was extremely comfortable. The return leg was on 23rd January 2015 (AI 775). The flight was delayed by about 90 minutes however I have no complaints because AI kept informing me through regular calls and texts about the exact status. The aircraft used in this leg was an old A319. The seats were torn and in some cases even the back rest was not upto the mark. I don't understand if AI can use their 787s in other domestic routes why not in the BOM-CCU sector? If not then why can't the A319s be replaced with the A320s which provide much better comfort. This is just a suggestion as I love flying AI. I would also like to appreciate the fact that in spite of the flight being delayed by 0 minutes we were served dinner on board. The dinner was excellent. Last but not the least I'd like to request AI to please reintroduce the entertainment system for the domestic sectors also so that we can enjoy the flight even more.
915,AI607 Mumbai-Bangalore on January 3rd. Flight was delayed but not so much by Indian standards. Plane was very very old. It felt like going back in time with some seats requiring quick repair before take off. Flight was a little unpleasant also because of the strong turbulence and a bunch of young crying kids. FA's were a little rude at times but always available. One very good thing is that a proper meal is served in a flight that is just over an hour long. While not my favorite I would still use them for flights within India in the future.
916,First time flying from Melbourne to Delhi and return. Dreamliner is great plane though found on both trips that remote controls were broken. Maintenance seems poor and seats dirty as well as hard though space is good. Very poor staff service and as remotes are broken you can't call attendants - deliberate? Toilets are very dirty and we ran out of toilet tissues. Had to remind staff. No cleaning of toilets as on most other airlines. Staff are lazy. Some exceptions but did not make up for non attentiveness. Could not believe poor movie choice - latest movies were two years old and most between 5-10 years. Issued good headphones but I used my Bose and relied on my own entertainment. We usually left late and the plane system is very poor in showing estimated arrival time. Food was poor. Was expecting some dinner and got served a snack which was terrible. Suspect I picked up Delhi belly on flights as well despite using my own hand cleaner. Will only use them as last resort. There are many better options. Use at your own risk.
917,This was our first trip on an Air India flight. I was interested to see how we found the trip I have flown on many other airlines in India. We had a very short trip from Udaiper to Mumbai. The flight arrived late they did try to make contact about this but the email arrived after we arrived in Mumbai. My main issue is that the stewards seemed to be totally indifferent towards their customers which I found to be unusual.
918,BOM-DEL-FRA: Domestic sector was served by a mediocre A320 whereas International sector was with 787 usual. Surprisingly both the sectors went smooth as compared to my first experience (read below). The crew were polite and accommodating and breakfast served on domestic sector was tasty although tea and coffee was like black water. International leg had only 30 passengers so was a very light flight. Crew made an exceptional job with very polite rounds of drinks lunch snacks and special plum cake served always with smile and were more than happy to serve larger portions. The younger crew made all the efforts to make flight comfortable by dimming the window and switching off unwanted TV screens and always attended passengers request. AI 787 Dreamliner have great legspace that beats all European Airlines although AI should urgently update their entertainment system. Just one tip AI should make more efforts to keep aircraft clean as they are brand new though looked outdated and dusty carpet. This flight was a great experience and looking forward to served in similar manner.
919,Flew EWR (Newark) to IXE (Manglore) in December and back January. This was not my first choice of airline but due to the holiday rush this was the best I could get. I expected delays surly staff poor communication bad seats and an uncomfortable experience. I was pleasantly surprised. The flights were on time the staff were a mixed bunch but none were rude the food was good (one meal was lukewarm and one sandwich had nothing in it) the movie selection was decent and the seats were quite comfortable. Overall a good experience. I'm not sure if I just got lucky w these flight but if this is the level of service now then it has improved tremendously and I would fly Air India again.
920,Flew from Delhi to Bangalore on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Good experience decent food and IFE for a very low price. Very comfortable seats was a bit late though.
921,Return flights from Birmingham to Bangkok via Delhi what a joke delayed for 24+ hours on both journeys at Delhi staff very unprofessional no communication no accommodation or food/drink vouchers. Avoid at all costs. Waiting for Air India to respond to my emails.
922,AI120 26th December. Arrival at FRA – discovered we could use any of the LH business lounges. Arrived at terminal A so used the brand new A lounge for a couple of hours (had a 6hr layover). Then took a trek to terminal B popped in to the lounge for an hour or so. Similar layout and food. Reception staff very pleasant. LH lounges are pleasant enough good selection of drinks food is at best minimal and quite uninteresting. WIFI is good – easy connect and quick enough to video skype. The B lounge is right next to the gate so it really is a 1 minute walk. No calls though and the monitors only show the boarding times so be careful! We strolled to the gate to find we were the last to board. Greeted very politely by the crew issued new boarding cards and shown to our seats which were taken. The interlopers were swiftly moved on and we sat and made ourselves comfortable. A choice of drinks was presented along with a hot towel and some eye masks. The crew were really nice a mix of ages and all were very pleasant courteous and helpful. Cabin décor leaves an awful lot to be desired but the seats are spacious and very comfortable. Not as garish as some of the pictures but definitely not easy on the eye. No sooner had we levelled off then the crew came round offering pre-dinner drinks and shortly after this it was time for dinner (it was a late flight). Flight crew arrived with cotton tablecloths and served either a chicken shashlik or prawn curry served with the usual naan rice and vegetables. Vegetarian options also available. Prawn curry was yummy. Washed down with a decent red wine. Slept the remainder of the flight to Delhi. 2nd Sector Delhi transit is a right PITA. Slow cumbersome numerous passport and boarding card checks. Eventually made it through (luckily at the front of the queue – if you had a short transfer you'd be in trouble). Lounge is pleasant. Except for some building work going on just outside. WIFI is incredibly difficult and awkward to connect to. Couple of PCs available. Didn't eat whilst we were there so can't comment on the food. Found a couple of recliners and slept for an hour. 10 minute walk to the gate boarded and departed right on time. Again the crew on board were really pleasant and very attentive. Mixed ages again. Greeted with drinks and hot towels. Limited movie choices. Again the food choice was limited but what was provided was delicious. A decent white wine this time and copious G&Ts combined for the next important stage of the journey – sleep! Seat is again a proper lie flat. Padding a bit thin but if you sleep on the duvet they provide this cushions the seat cover. A thin blanket (also provided) is enough as a cover as the cabin is warm. Got woken about an hour or so before landing and had a really nice chicken biryani for breakfast. Bit odd but not much else to choose from. Landed smoothly but unfortunately no priority bags on arrival. Not a big issue but would have been nice. We consoled ourselves that the bags had arrived at all. Overall – great value great staff delicious food very comfortable flight on time and safe. The whole experience was surprisingly pleasant and I would use them again.
923,Flew on SYD-DEL sector last month. Food is really good specially if you love Indian food. Entertainment system is good with lot of Bollywood options English selections are though few. Seats were wide and comfortable but a bit hard for 13 hour journey. Staff is courteous and listens to you unlike some Chinese airlines where it was a nightmare to make them understand what you needed. Arrival and departure time are perfect if you live in Delhi and Sydney.
924,I traveled thrice to Delhi from JFK and back in 2014 and I feel now I would prefer any other airline if I have an option next time when I travel. The last trip I took was on the last week of December 2014. Pros - Flight is pretty much always on time and the fare is reasonable compared to most other international airlines on the same route. Cons - The seats are not so comfortable firm dirty as if the covers have not been cleaned or washed in a long time. The crew members are not of the standard to be aboard an international flight. They just lack service quality compared to the likes of Emirates or Qatar. Very unprofessional. They only show up during refreshment services. Care less to see if any passengers would need assistance with anything else through out the flight. They don't clean the rest rooms or feel the need to fill in tissues once these runs out. Half of the entertainment systems are broken and rest are just slow. They also barely update the contents in the entertainment systems. I traveled back to back in two months and found same movies. Food is horrible. Just bad. Air India domestic has far better service.
925,LHR-DEL-BKK. Ticket was cheap and onboard food was as good as you get in Economy class. However I found the cabin crew to be lazy as they never responded to the call button meaning I had to go to the galley when I wanted something like a drink. Also the entertainment was disappointing because although it was video-on-demand the selection of decent Western films was limited and there was no Western music only Indian. Furthermore the staff at Delhi Airport were so rude with far too many checks yet insufficient staff that meant getting through checks at Delhi during transit took far too long. Basically I will only go with Air India again if it is dirt cheap.
926,My return flight from Mumbai to London was via Delhi. The flight departure times of the first leg Mumbai-Delhi (AI809) have been changed 3 times since I booked the flight in September. This has caused so many uncertainties with hotel booking in Mumbai. The final departure time was delayed by 3 hours to 7AM thus making it an uncomfortable morning on the day. To add to the misery when I reached the airport I learnt that the flight is delayed by 2.20 hours. This information was obtained by enquiring the assistance desk - none of the flight status TVs had updated this information.
927,FRA-DEL-MUM: 30th Nov 14. Ground staff to aircraft crew were just disinterested. Passengers were greeted by young friendly crew but that's it. Other members clearly were not happy with their jobs. Captains announcement were rather short and straight. Seats still had bread crumbs on them and tables had oily stains this was on a new 787-8. Drinks had restricted choice. Cola or Juice. Food served in aluminium foil was shabbily presented and was overcooked. Crew members never gave service with smile although they did attend when called. Domestic sector was better than international flight. Aircraft was extremely old with tattered carpet and food was again shabbily presented but crew were polite and accommodating. Air India its time to pull up your socks as a part of star alliance passengers will choose to other airlines to your shabby service. Lack of Professionalism was very evident!
928,"DEL-BKK. They got me there (not my bag however). I was on a new 787 in Business and the interior was a bit dowdy and there was a large chunk of my window armrest missing exposing the foam beneath. The amenities were slippers and an eye shade in a paper bag. The crew was present but not really involved with the passengers outside of the necessary interactions. All the meal offerings were Indian with one being vegetarian. It was all served on a single tray and the wine ""selection"" was red or white - served from half bottles. The overall experience was equivalent to a similar 4 hour sector in the US in First where the product is improved over coach but the flight did not measure up to other international carriers."
929,Travelled Bangalore Mumbai Delhi and back in September 2014. First plane was airbus A319 second was airbus A320. The good: Flights took off and landed on time. Clean and neat aircraft's. Polite crew smooth procedures everywhere. Average food. Inflight entertainment was there from BOM to DEL. The bad: No IFE on the DEL-BLR flight Expensive airfare at times. Limited supply of Non veg food.
930,Air India AI996 DXB-DEL B777-300ER. Full flight on Dec 24. Air India ground services handled by local handler DNATA was a disaster. Check in was relatively smooth but boarding gate was changed from C13 to C7 and there was no announcement to inform passengers. The crowded boarding gate was disorganized and no proper announcement was made to give priority boarding. Flight crew seemed to be less interested in service. Food was good and service was quick. Inflight entertainment was decent enough though live flight map was not available. Seats were little shabby and was in need of maintenance. Overall experience was below expectation.
931,I flew DME-DEL-GOI-DEL-DME in mid December. What can I say - before making the first flight with AI I thought it wouldn't be the best experience. Now the reality: staff are polite and efficient both on international and domestic segments. A bit unorganized on the ground. Food - good. It's Indian expect curry but a very good curry and quite a large portion. aircraft's: all-new 787 and 319. They are just new and I have nothing to complain. Entertainment system is not to Emirates standards but quite close to that on Lufthansa's new 747-8. So the price is not cheap but the airline provides a good product for that price. Will fly them again.
932,Extremely poor service in terms of time management. Flying London to Mumbai Via Delhi on Air India. Connecting flight from Delhi got changed without any information. The transit flight schedule changed from a waiting time of 1 hour to 6.5 hours. When enquired and made a complaint we got put on an earlier flight which had 4 hour wait this was because we had a child passenger. Landed in Delhi airport to find out that even the changed connecting flight was delayed. Waited for 6.5 hours in the airport for the connecting flight. My little boy was exhausted and tired and our holiday mood completely ruined with such a bad start losing a whole complete day of your holiday due to your airline's fault is not something you want to experience again. Just one misery after another. No apology offered and no compensation offered. Avoid this airline at any cost.
933,I flew from Heathrow to Delhi in the B787. The seat was extremely comfortable but the inflight entertainment system did not work for the whole flight! The cabin was extremely cold. Luckily on the trip back from Delhi to Heathrow we were in the B777-300ER we had lovely seats next to the loo and tea machine and our inflight entertainment system worked a treat. The food was also great and the air hostesses were excellent. All in all I would fly the Air India B777-300ER again!
934,I travelled on Air India recently from Singapore to Chennai. The flight was on time good hot breakfast was served. IFE had good selection of Indian and English movies. The best part is the spacious new 787 Dreamliner had full flat beds. It was very comfortable. FA were attentive and polite.
935,Travelled Birmingham to Delhi return in November 2014. Found the Dreamliner very comfortable. There was only a slight delay on the return flight due to a counter glitch at Delhi airport. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. I must congratulate Air India in employing crew members of all ages. Both my wife and I have noticed a major improvement in services offered by Air India. I hope the Airline continue to provide this level of service. The food offered during the flight was of a good standard. Finally the Maharaja Lounge at Delhi airport was of a high standard.
936,Birmingham to Amritsar. I was impressed with new Dreamliner seats entertainment everything spot on. Staff really good and helpful. Due to Fog flight was delayed (2 hours) from BHX and on the way back again due to Fog flight was 3 hours delayed from ATQ. Air India took care of all the passengers on the airport and provided Breakfast and snacks. Delay in DEL airport (we had to wait for 5 hours and we were not allowed to go out) its a shame. Don't know what the reason was for delay. Other than that no issues no problems.
937,Family of 4 holding Executive Class tickets to Chennai on Wednesday 26 Nov 2014 - food was not very good. Staff service okay. Did not understand why the staff allow economy passengers to walk through the Biz class to use the toilets. Staff from Singapore to Chennai did not give us menu cards but Chennai to Singapore the staff did and found time to talk to us and explain the meals. Inflight movie was good. I like Air India I just wish that people in the Indian airports can be more organised. I will compliment the inflight staff out of Chennai but not as good from Singapore. Overall needs improvement to attract more passengers to Biz.
938,I am a frequent flyer in the BOM-CCU sector. At first I was quite apprehensive to fly Air India because of the frequent delays. To my surprise the flights were excellent for both legs and on time departure and arrival. The crew were excellent both ways. Hot and delicious breakfast were served both ways. There was no IFE on either flights. The seats were comfortable with ample leg room.
939,Delhi-London-Delhi Business Class travel in November this year. The journey was overall comfortable with good seats and ontime performance. DEL-LHR sector good cabin crew with average service they say X brand of beer available and when you ask they say oh its not cold we have Y brand. The food layout was average nothing to compare with BA or Emirates they are superb. LHR-DEL menu card given and then taken back saying sorry it was the First Class Menu please read the Business Class now. The crew were a lot older and I guessed that might be the reason for not apt customer service barring 1 or 2 crew members. All in all a great price though and convenient timings which makes it a choice. Full flights considering now a part of Star Alliance. If the customer service and food is improved marginally then full marks for sure.
940,A319 from Mumbai to Bangalore. Delayed start arrived 20 min late. Clean cabin with half the IFE not working. Friendly crew quick breakfast service. Poor meal with flimsy plastic cutlery. Apparently a recent cost cutting measure. The flimsy hot beverage cup had no handle just a tab to hold with the tips of two fingers!
941,Ageing A-320 from Bangalore to Mumbai. Some fixtures missing. Starboard engine made a constant loud jarring noise in the front cabin for about 15-20 min until plane settled into cruise. On time departure and landed 15 min early. Decent meal but with the new cost-cutting plastic cutlery. Crew were friendly and happily served extra beverage in a proper cup this time.
942,First time flying with Air India from LHR to Delhi. The outbound flight AI 116 was delayed by 1.5 hours due to technical issues on the aircraft - Boeing Dreamliner. Check-in was breeze and staff were professional and friendly. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to business class. Seats and cabin was extremely comfortable and seats reclined flat. Service was good and friendly but it lacked the professionalism experienced on other premium carriers - the younger staff not as diligent as older staff. Food was good although the red wine was exceptional. Inflight not great but still had enough variety to pass the time. Return flight was on Boeing 777 in economy- surprised by the amount of legroom and comfort of seat - better than BA! Again found older staff better than younger staff. Food was disappointing although no worse than BA - I found the pre-landing snack inedible. Also I found the control functions for lights games and tv were not working. In fact the tv for both my wife and son were not working at all. Luckily I had my tablets and iPad! Overall I found AI no worse than travelling on BA. Service could be improved and some the aircraft facilities need updating but the same can be said for many other flag carriers.
943,On October 31 2014 I had the unpleasant experience of traveling from JFK to DEL via Air India - the onboard service was horrendous. I was escorted in the wrong direction on boarding once I eventually got to my seat I waited almost 10 mins for someone to put my jacket away I eventually had to get up and hand the flight attendant my jacket. Very odd odour from the carpet. Requested a special meal 4 weeks in advance it was confirmed but not provided. No menu for dinner and breakfast options flight attendant walked up and down asking veg or non-veg food presentation was below par. On board movie selection was outdated - seat 8H had mechanical failure would not recline. Bathroom were dirty 6 hours into the 14 hour flight. Flight attendants provided wrong immigration paperwork causing delay in DEL.
944,Dreamliner - Melbourne to New Delhi Oct 22nd 2014 and return 1st Nov 2014. Before flying I read the negative reports and I was concerned but the Dreamliner flights were very good. Only complaint was their movie selections did not work properly. As with all aircraft the seats are small for a larger person.
945,After 2 flights with Jet Airways from Bangkok to India in their poor quality business class my company booked me on Air India and this was a pleasant surprise. New planes (Dreamliner) good seats fully reclining friendly and attentive attendants reasonably good food and average entertainment system a reason for me now to continue flying on Air India with the bonus of the Star Alliance mileage.
946,London-Delhi-Sydney in Business. Was the cheapest business one-way so I didn't have too high expectations but I would use them again. London-Delhi full 777 which was well maintained and the seats spacious. Cabin crew were all very pleasant food nice if you like curry. Seat turns into a reasonable flat bed. Transit at Delhi much less painful than I feared. Lounge pretty ordinary with limited food and drink and leaking showers despite being fairly new. Flight to Sydney (via Melbourne) left an hour late and on 787 Dreamliner which was very new with more spacious seats and cabin less than 1/4 full. Food again decent curries very friendly service slept for about 8 hours. Inflight TV hopeless on both flights unless you are into Bollywood so take an iPad. Only negative was that there was a lot of confusion as to whether you need to get off in Melbourne (we did in the end) and a long wait for transit security.
947,I travelled Sydney-Hyderabad via New Delhi on 16th August 2014 and the flight was delayed by 1.5 hours and I missed my connecting flight to Hyderabad. After 2 hours I was given overnight accommodation and booked in the morning flight to Hyderabad. I had the same bizarre experience on my return flight to Sydney via New Delhi on 23/10/2014. I got a phone call a day before the flight that it has been modified and will leave couple of hours early and will go to Delhi via Vishakhapatnam. The flight from Hyderabad was delayed again by an hour due to check-in system being down which again resulted in me missing my connection to Sydney. There were 8 passengers connecting to Sydney and a notification by the captain was not good enough to save our day. It does not end here at immigration I had my departure stamp and as I was waiting for my wife and kids passports to get stamped when the Air India staff informed us that the flight to Sydney is now closed and we can't board the aircraft. It took another 4 hours to do the paperwork to cancel the departure stamp on my passport. Then the routine of going to hotel and take the flight the next day. There is no sense of customer service or sympathy at this inconvenience. I would make every effort never to fly Air India again. The only good thing about the journey was the plane itself. There is ample legroom the seats are comfortable and the dreamliner 787 windows are dimmed to give night experience. Flight staff service varies person to person - some are good and others indifferent. Overall do not fly Air India if you don't have the buffer time to offset for these delays.
948,I travelled to Bangkok from Delhi on 12th Oct'14. The flight was delayed by 1.5 hours but we somehow managed that delay. My return flight was on 23rd Oct'14 - the flight was delayed by 5 hours. I had to catch next flight (after 2 hours) from Delhi to Lucknow on the same day. I had to literally beg them to transfer me to another flight. I don't understand why Air India flights are always delayed and other airlines are always on time. They have got good aircraft but there attitude towards passengers and time management needs to be improved.
949,Peak Season flight-AI 602 last night. Our original flight was the late night 11pm flight which was delayed by an hour or so. We requested the airline staff at the airport to change us to an earlier flight due to this delay. In spite of the flight being totally packed they were kind enough to accommodate us on the 9pm flight. As for the flight it was great we had premium economy seats great food on time good service and a no-bumps ride. Also not to mention one of the most engaging pilot who gave us stats on every single item relating to the flight-it just felt good!
950,Flew in March April Sept Oct 2014 between UK and Delhi. I would recommend AI but carry your own food. Timely. Good flights. Choice and quality of food / drinks unsatisfactory. Cannot explain why food was of such poor quality - stale fruit poor presentation. Rescheduled my departure from Delhi without a problem.
951,"Travelled from Sydney to Delhi on 04 October AI301. Got a notice via email that flight was delayed by 20 minutes but the flight took off 2 hours late hence I missed my connecting flight. Requested an aisle seat they issued me a boarding pass with 15G when I was about to board the aircraft they gave my seat to another passenger without even consulting me and then they changed my seat to 12E. When I reached the aircraft I found a passenger sitting on 12E. I spoke to cabin staff who said they will look into it which they never did when I confronted her again she said sit wherever you can. I heard the staff suggesting to 2 passenger with same seat number to keep switching seats during the flight. I requested a special meal which they said they didn't have. When I reached Delhi Airport I was advised that my flight had left and will have to take another flight the next morning. They said they will arrange a hotel I waited for 2 hours for that to happen and I had to approach staff again to get this done. They took me to something that they called a hotel but it was ugly and under construction. I said I didn't want to stay there and they said we have another property. Entrance to that property was via the kitchen - I didn't even check the room and asked to be dropped back at Delhi Airport. I was made to sign a receipt of 2500Rs for the 30 minute stay at their hotel. All airlines are sometimes late flights get cancelled and all sorts of things happen but my problem with Air India was that no one had a slightest clue of what they were doing. When I spoke to the manager he said ""Do whatever you want"" I don't have authority to do anything and there is nothing that can be done tonight. India is a great nation and Air India brings shame to this great nation by associating itself with this great name. Absolutely irresponsible clueless and have no regard towards basic human feeling. Please don't travel Air India as I will never again."
952,New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights. My expectations were low but I was more than satisfied and I would consider flying with them again.
953,AI 667/668 between BOM-TRV-BOM. A319. Check-in quick and efficient. Flights clean and comfortable. On time one way slightly delayed the other. Good breakfast service cabin crew helpful. Quickly disembarked both times. No complaints. Ticket was about 35% cheaper than the nearest competitor.
954,I travel Air India 3-4 times a year. This time I was travelling from Delhi (DEL) to Kochi (KOX) on an A320 the seats were not comfortable at all. The TV on the flight was not working. The food was horrible.
955,The Dreamliner flight from Sydney to Delhi was a disappointment. 1) Seats were very cramped. Not adequate leg space for such a long flight. 2) Toilets were dirty and toilet tissues were not replaced. 3) The entire economy seating area smelt. 4) A snack and a drink was very much needed before landing. Just two meals for a 13 hour flight was not adequate. 5) Fruit juice and diet drinks were not available after the first meal service. 6) A wet wipe or steamed towel should have been provided at the end of such along flight. We had to disembark even without being able to freshen up. Definitely not up to international standards.
956,"CDG-SYD (via DEL and MEL). Check-in was a mess at CDG - told to leave executive line and wait to the side - then told to get back in to executive class line after waiting for several minutes to the side. AI use Cathay lounge for this flight at terminal 2C and its really nice. 787 Dreamliner for both legs. My overall impression is that this plane is massively over hyped from a customer aspect anyway - there is really nothing special about this plane - the windows are the most noticeable difference- and while this is nice during the couple of minutes during taking off and landing - you don't notice it for the rest of the flight. Everything is plastic on this plane - the toilet door feels like an ice cream container lid. The seat is comfortable in bed mode it is wide and well padded - but there is no Z-mode for relaxation - you can put the backrest back and the footrest up but the seat remains flat at all times - its not really that comfortable for relaxing/watching TV. A sat in cushion and a larger cotton pillow are provided - which are very comfortable in addition to a duvet and a thin blanket - which makes a great sleeping experience. IFE screen is large and high definition - there is a reasonable choice of (both Indian and Western) movies and television shows - but not quite enough to stretch out for the 12 hour flight. Food was variable. No menus provided - options were stated by staff at the time of meal service. Out of CDG the supper was lobster with champagne sauce - it was dry and tough - but definitely still lobster which is great in business class. Otherwise all the other meals were curry and sandwiches were offered on the Melbourne to Sydney leg - really this should be a proper breakfast. An announcement was made that no alcohol could be served on the domestic leg from MEL to SYD - what they actually mean is no duty free alcohol can be served - its pretty cheap to stop serving alcohol just because you have to pay the duty on it. Almost all passengers immediately removed their shoes and socks immediately upon boarding - so be prepared for the feet. The staff are a mixed bunch - some are fantastic - friendly smiling communicative and anticipating requests - these staff were all female. Unfortunately the male staff were some of the most surly resentful and unpleasant people I have ever encountered in a business class cabin - attendant call button was met with a ""yes"" and a glare from these men. The lounge at Delhi was interesting - I was there at from 9-12 am this is a big lounge with many comfortable chairs but limited food and drink options. Showers were available. Wifi was difficult to access staff seemed disinterested and resentful of requests for assistance - there is clearly no customer service mentality about this place. Overall this was a very average experience and certainly the worst business class flight I have ever taken - however the price was very reasonable and I would consider booking it again and I would cautiously recommend Air India."
957,"Trying to get to Delhi from Bombay for a 6pm wedding. Our 1pm flight - cancelled till 2.30pm. 2.30pm flight - told at counter it was over-booked and is now full. The next available flight is at 5pm - delayed till 5.20pm without prior notice. 5.45pm - begin takeoff procedures. 5.55pm - electrical failure. Plane comes to a standstill. Lights and AC continue to be switched on and off. 6pm - captain announces ""there has been an electrical failure and out technical team is on their way to trouble-shoot"". No further explanation offered. No beverages offered. If you got up to ask for water they did oblige by giving you one small glass. 6.45pm - herded like animals and packed like sardines onto a stationary bus on the tarmac. When asked what was happening and where we were going we were told ""nowhere. you can not stand on the tarmac so you must sit on the bus and wait while we do final checks onboard. The buses were over-packed and we were locked inside while staff and drivers disappeared. 7.15pm - finally start to re-board passengers. We decide not to get back onto an aircraft that has electrical failures. We demanded our luggage and a full refund. The ground staff obliged however sent us wondering around the airport unescorted in search of the duty manager. This whole process took until 8pm. After 7 hours all delays and cancellations sitting around the airport on the plane on buses and being spoken to in a patronising manner by everyone from ground staff to on-flight staff we did not end up flying to Delhi and we have missed our friends wedding. I will never fly with or recommend Air India."
958,Traveled on New Delhi to Dubai sector AI 995 on brand new B787 Dreamliner. Check in was easy and hassle free. Boarding too went smoothly. Flight departed 10 minutes early. Aircraft was brand new fresh. Cabin was spacious and seating arrangement was a comfortable 3-3-3 layout. Contrary to expectation the seat width was not wide enough and there was a general discomfort in seating. Inflight entertainment was excellent with a wide range of movies and shows. There were 5 regional movies available in my native language an experience never found in any other flights. Food as usual was very good though the crew were asking passengers whether they are strict vegetarians as they were running out of veg meals due many passengers pre ordered veg meals. Landed 20 minutes before scheduled arrival time. The overall travel experience was excellent and B787 Dreamliner is one perfect aircraft to fly.
959,Took a late night flight on AI from DEL to BOM recently. Aircraft was a 321 and the flight was over booked. Yet service was excellent great food. The aircraft was in decent condition. Flight slightly bumpy but that can be blamed on the rains around Mumbai.
960,Flying to the Maldives via Mumbai from Ahmedabad on Sept 14th. Checked in and were told flight was on time. We were to have a 5 hour break in Mumbai giving us plenty of time to catch connection on Sri Lanka Airways. The flight never arrived and was 4 hours late taking off although AI personnel insisting we would make our connection. Never did no help from AI personnel in Mumbai and worst experience on a flight ended up in transit at the airport for over 26 hours.
961,Booked just a day early on AI to take the very early morning flight from DEL to MUM last week. Very reasonable fare (even for last min) great aircraft 787 and good service.
962,I was excited to be travelling on Air India's new 'Dreamliner' from Sydney to Delhi yesterday. The experience fell well short of my expectations. I endeavoured to do on-line check-in but it was not available so I phoned and requested an aisle set. That request was never registered but the check-in assistant in Sydney gave me an exit row seat which I was very happy with. On the flight the entertainment system for my seat 30C was not working. I initially complained but I was dismissed by the first flight attendant and told I would need to wait for it to cut in. After an hour of waiting I approached another flight attendant who assured me he would re-set the system. Following another few failed attempts I was assured that they would register the fact that it wasn't working and that it would fixed for the next passenger. Not sure how that helped me! When it came time for meal- time the flight attendant asked me to pull out my tray and was irritated when I couldn't. The tray was actually broken. She did endeavour to fix it but it remained a problem throughout the flight. Unfortunately the entertainment system appears to control the overhead lighting as well. The result was that I had no access to movies music or reading light for the full flight which is 12 hrs 30 minutes that's a long time to sit in the dark. There was no apology or understanding from staff. The food was very basic with little variety there was minimal genuine service on the flight. Staff seemed to vanish between meals and seemed irritated when a passenger asked for something. If anything I found some of the staff quite rude. This was a very full flight I think staff need to pay some attention to the toilets during the trip. At one stage one of the toilet basins was clogged and another passenger complained to staff. I do a lot of travel and this is the worst flights I have taken. I would endeavour never to fly Air India again but from Sydney to Delhi there is very little choice of operators. Hopefully Air India will develop a true sense of service before my next trip.
963,August 2014 - Flew the Dreamliner from Paris to Delhi. The departure was on-time and arrival in Delhi was 20 minutes before time. The aircraft looked new seats were comfortable cabin crew was efficient and had nice smiles on their faces (much more welcoming than many other airlines in my experience). Food was good in-flight entertainment offered a lot of choice although it was slightly heavier in terms of Bollywood stuff. Decent sized blankets in this era of cost-saving with most other airlines offering half-sized blankets! Baggage arrived on the belt in Delhi minutes after landing. All in all a very positive experience and I'll definitely fly Air India again.
964,JFK-DEL on 3 Aug and BOM-JFK on 23 Aug. Cabin crew disappear during the night. On other airlines they walk through the cabin a few times with glasses of water for passengers. Not on AI. I discovered that they put out cookies sandwiches and soft drinks for passengers in one of the galleys but there was no announcement made. No drinks were offered on the BOM-JFK flight.
965,Newark to Calcutta and back. I figured there is a reason why the tickets were cheaper than other airlines. After all you get what you pay for. But I have to admit after traveling to Calcutta and coming back to the US that I am quite satisfied with the service offered by Air India. Staff were courteous professional helpful and food was excellent. The only complaint I have is the seat quality the seats are extremely uncomfortable almost felt like I was sitting on a piece of wood during the lengthier legs of the flight (Newark to Mumbai Mumbai to Newark). Seat quality is very important especially for a 16 hour duration flight. Surprisingly the seats were roomier and a bit more comfortable on the flight from Mumbai to Calcutta. I wish it worked the other way round. Air India is known for delays but no complaints there either in fact we arrived early from Mumbai from Newark.
966,DEL to GOI via BOM. Tatty old A321 that looked liked it hadn't been properly clean since being brought into service 20 years ago. Washroom basin filthy with brown stains everywhere. Surly crew who were mannerless. Cramped uncomfortable seats. No alcohol or soft drinks available on either legs. Sat on plane at Mumbai whilst plane serviced for 40 minutes - terribly unprofessional ground crew cleaning the plane around you.
967,We were on flight from BLR-BOM-JDH. The flight was on-time entertainment systems were working properly the crew was polite lunch was satisfactory. Aircraft A319 seemed new and comfortable.
968,Flew from Chicago to Delhi the leg room in the airplane was good but its a poorly maintained aircraft. The entire plane was dirty. One of the toilets were not working. The snacks were not served you had to walk to the back of the aircraft to find a sandwich and a drink. Horrible experience.
969,Delhi-Kolkata-Delhi. Delhi-Kolkata (CCU) on Airbus A321. Kolkata-Delhi on Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. Both flights were on time and aircraft's were considerably clean. Check in (both times) took hardly 5 minutes. IFE on A321 was not good but B787 had great collection of movies and music however most of earphones provided were broken (carry your own earphone). Food was a complete let down on both flights and staff did little to make your journey better. Overall for 2 hour flights Air India is a good option given its price. Also Air India and Jet Airways operate from Terminal 3 in Delhi which makes airport experience slightly better than other domestic airlines.
970,Avoid at all costs! Terrible experience with Air India. They ran out of non veg meals On my flight from Chicago to Delhi and then again from Delhi to Cochin. On the return trip the Cochin to Mumbai flight was delayed 2 hours causing us to miss the Mumbai to Newark flight. Waited in Mumbai for over 3 hours while their clueless officials tried to get us back to Toronto somehow. After telling us of a few possible flights for the next day even coming close to booking us they finally found a flight via Istanbul. No upgrades of any sort not even an apology. Never again will I travel with Air India!
971,EWR-BOM-AMD. Flight was supposed to depart on 3 July 2014 I flew on 5th July. Everything went well until take off there was a problem with the air-conditioning which was not resolved at all. After 4.5 hours we were told to get off the plane. After getting our baggage we were told to stand in a queue for 40 mins to get hotel vouchers and after getting the voucher I was waited for the hotel transportation for 3 hours. We were 54 passengers and there was only 1 bus which could carry 34 passengers. Back to the airport for 11 am next day told to stand in line for another flight which was at 4 pm on 4 July 2014. After standing in line for 4 hours I was told the flight was full and another was scheduled for 8. Boarded the flight and after 2 hrs we were told that there was problem with the engine and it took them another 4 hours to decide that we had to get off the plane again another motel was given. Spoke to a manager of Air India and they got me on 5th July's AI 190 EWR-BOM-AMD flight. Finally on 5th July I arrived home 72 hours late. I have decided not to fly Air India in the future.
972,We flew JFK-DEL-JFK in May 2014 with a 10 month old infant. Partial journey from JFK to DEL was ok however on DEL-JFK route AI ground staff were horrible. Although an infant bassinet was requested from the get-go and we were at the terminal 3 hours before boarding staff at DEL Airport were rude and flatly answered no bassinets available. On duty staff didn't know who to escalate issue to find out an answer they directed us from counter to counter. 90 minutes trying to get a bassinet with no success. Surprisingly when we entered the plane and found that there were 8 bassinet locations and only 2 bassinets were hooked up and remaining bassinet assigned seats were allotted to regular people families with no kids. We were shocked and asked a few people occupying those seats to exchange with us but no one would. We had a hard time travelling for those 15 hours with our infant child. We found at least 2 other kids facing the similar dilemma and going through the sufferings due to incompetent ground staff.
973,"Flying Air India with my 82 year old mother and 13 year old daughter was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Although I had confirmed seats at JFK I was told that the plane only had the capacity to take 200 out of the 380 passengers. After complete chaos and AI employees who had no clue on how to control the crowd or make a decision we were that night put on a flight to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines and from there to Bombay with the promise that Air India representative would meet us at the gate in Bombay and help me with claiming my luggage since it was left in New York with Air India transportation to the domestic airport and tickets to my final destination. No one met me at Bombay but the worst part was they refused to provide any assistance. The supervisor at the baggage claim told me in no uncertain terms ""we will not help you."" I had to file a claim for my luggage with Turkish although I never checked my luggage with them. We were so distressed and tired but not one Air India representative showed any concern and they refused to let us in the shuttle to domestic airport. The Air India representative at the transit gate told me that I could spend the entire day trying to talk to someone high up in AI or get a taxi to the domestic airport. I reached Bombay at 4.30 am and finally got the evening flight to Kochi which then was turned around half way and returned to Bombay for technical reasons. The funny thing is no one in India seemed very surprised at our experience flying with Air India. Customer service seems to be the last thing on the minds with Air India. My mother still has not recuperated from her travel and I am never traveling Air India again."
974,Flew the Dreamliner from Singapore to Frankfurt via Delhi. They had their new (plated) catering on board but still the choice and quality disappointing and the service average which is a shame as Indian food can be outstanding even the curry option was very disappointing. The cabin crew in business on whole do not seem comfortable or confident and are usually older. I mention the age issue only because I think that they have been used to a different type of service which no longer is the standard for business class. I appears that the business cabin crew are chosen on seniority and Air India needs to change this and use younger crew who can bring a new attitude and freshness to the service. Having said that the seat for sleeping was excellent with nice large pillows and good quality cotton quilts. The Dreamliner definitely delivers a much better cabin comfort and had a major affect on jet lag. We had 1.5 hr scheduled transit in Delhi which was a worry we ended up with 60 mins to complete the transfer which we did ok as we had already been issued boarding passes in Singapore. Having said that value for money is excellent. I know many have disliked the decor and I have to agree that it doesn't come up to Cathay's but its ok. If they can just up their game with cabin crew and food Air India could become a great airline.
975,MEL-LHR-MEL in June. Aircraft: Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room and the seat pitch is very good and comfortable the cabin environment is nice. Food: curry was the only option and catered for Indian passengers. Very limited option (no alternatives). No child's meal provided requested at the time of booking and it was not available (so if you are travelling with children please take your own food). Refreshments only served with meals not provided in any other times considering the long flights on all the sector. Entertainment: Is mainly aimed at Indian audiences very limited entertainment and games for kids (suggest taking a tablet/DS loaded with your favourite movies or games to keep them occupied). The senior management need more focus to improve the standard and efficiency as Air India has joined star alliance they need to improve on following to be par with other major airlines and to attract more passengers with different nationalities. Cabin crew must improve their customer service. More variety of food option for all ages especially for children. Refreshments are served on regular basis on long flights. Noted that toilets are not cleaned during the long flight and some are unusable due to cleanliness. It appears that cabin crews not checking are more interested in resting in their pods for majority of the flights. Improvement on on-time performance as our both outbound and inbound flights are delayed. Surely would like to fly once again and hope the service will improve with joining with star alliance and management focus to turnaround the airline.
976,My husband and I took Air India from Kolkata to Singapore. Our domestic flight was good but the international flight was horrible. We were given different seats no blankets were provided and the food was cold and very small in quantity. Even the inflight entertainment was zero as nothing was working in order. Whole journey we suffered a lot.
977,Delhi-Mumbai-Jamnagar and back during Jun 2014. Poor Management. The seats booked online are often changed without any information and family members are split up. Non-Veg food finishes within first 2-3 rows (either side). Food quality is poor. Inflight entertainment system does not work.
978,"Overall the service on the flight was inline with other international carriers. The food was acceptable curry was the only option and I suggest that all passengers opt for the ""veg"" option. Entertainment is mainly aimed at Indian audiences and I expected and agree with this. I suggest taking a tablet loaded with your favourite movies or shows - but I would do this on any airline. The 787 is by far much more comfortable that the 777. Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room is normal the seat pitch is incredible the cabin environment is lovely and the atmospheric conditions are noticeably better on the 787. (I didn't think this after the outbound journey which consisted of two 787 sectors. The return journey was a 777 sector followed by a 787 sector this is when you notice how great the 787 really is). Transit via Delhi: Information around this process is extremely hard to find on the internet with mixed reviews on sites such as this. If you are an international transiting passenger (i.e. you have landed in Delhi and are connecting with another Air India flight within 24 hours) then you do not need a visa so long as you are not exceeding 24 hours and are not leaving the terminal. There are two options inside the terminal for accommodation. I have done both. Eaton Smart Hotel - transit hotel - This is the option for a transit greater than 4 hours. If you stay here you can also leave the hotel and access any facilities in the terminal - just keep you passport and boarding card with you. Sams Pods - Ideal for less than 4 hours. $10US/ hour. You have access to a bed TV and desk in a small pod in the terminal building. No access to wash facilities other than those provided in the terminal. If you have a flight with Air India and have a long transit it would be well worth you questioning your ability to get a hotel paid for by the airline. I paid for mine as advised for by my flight centre agent. All other passengers on my flight managed to get this included in their ticket free of charge. If you pay for it you are looking at $190AUD."
979,I boarded Dreamliner AI 130 LHR-BOM on 1st July 2014. The flight was to leave at 13.30 hrs. Our plane was delayed due to a technical fault. We were served food around 14.30hrs but deplaned around 18.00hrs. We were taken back through immigration and left to stand in the exit lobby for 3 hours. We were bussed to Heston Hotel but no accommodation was available. After waiting outside for over an hour we were bussed to accommodation in Bentley Hotel reaching well past midnight. No meal provided. Next day (July 2nd) we were bussed after breakfast to Heston Hotel for lunch then to the original departure lounge at LHR. Flight was scheduled for 14.30. Then 16.00hrs. At 19.00hrs we were given meal vouchers. Finally we boarded after 22.00hrs. The flight took off at 11.30 hrs 31 hours late. At no time was information given voluntarily. Air India agents mostly left it to LHR staff to take care of angry passengers. No provision was made for passenger comfort particularly families with small children and the elderly. Passengers were made to stand for hours in areas where there was little or no seating. No effort was made to provide meals at reasonable intervals. We had to ask for vouchers. Passengers were not informed about the plan of action resulting in frayed tempers. Our luggage was not handed over to us. Aisle seat 11c restricts free passage quite severely. Passengers occupying this seat are trodden on and bumped by boarding/disembarking passengers. Except for the centre block row 11 has nowhere to stow small belongings not even under the seat. Many passengers did not know how to flush the toilets resulting in filthy conditions. Instructions must be given along with the safety check. Buttons operating screen light etc on the inside of the armrest can be accidentally knocked.
980,Traveled from NY (JFK) to DEL (IGI) in May 2014. The ticket was slightly more expensive than other airlines but the flight was half empty. The plane was a Boeing 777-300ER with a very nice cabin and a 3-3-3 configuration (unlike 3-4-3 on most other airlines). I requested the air hostess to move me from the front row to some empty seats behind and she happily did so. I was in the center aisle and both seats besides me were empty I could sleep (laid on 3 seats) all the way through without any disturbance. The food was excellent staff was good and the in- flight entertainment was nice (not the best but you will like it esp. if you are an Indian). Flight was on time. I would certainly recommend Air India it esp for the JFK-DEL route.
981,I travelled on Air India from London(LHR) to Chennai via Bombay. The first leg was a brand new 787 it is great product seating 3-3-3 and much better leg room then any other airline. I am tall 6.2 ft still I find very comfortable seating. On board we had 3 servings one drinks service with beer wine and spirits one good full meal with choice of Chicken fish or veg options and one snack before landing. For 8 an hours flight - lots of food. Good quality food and we enjoyed it and there were desserts too! Inflight entertainment was good with choice of new Hollywood and Bollywood movies TV shows sports and business section - enough to keep us busy for 8 hours. FA's were good lots of smiles and caring for kids and elders. Toilets were kept clean all the time. Flight landed in Bombay full 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The second leg was an A319 again good product hot breakfast served with choice of either Scrambled eggs and potato or South Indian Veg. We all enjoyed the breakfast. Air India has improved a lot and now stands on par with other international airlines. I will fly again and recommend fully.
982,Flew on the brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Amritsar from Delhi. Fascinating experience. The plane met all my expectations with beautifully designed cabin and lighting. The meal was also served despite being a 45 minutes journey. Surely would like to fly one again.
983,5th June flight AI 302 and returned on 16th June flight AI 301. Traveled to Sydney from Delhi and back on Dreamliner very convenient timings excellent staff service. Nothing better than a direct flight will travel again on Air India to international destinations.
984,Flew BOM-GOI and back (AI 661 and 662). Outbound: A321- Check-in smooth flight was delayed by 30 mins due to airport congestion was kept informed by the cockpit crew with regular updates. Crew were attentive friendly and responsive - although only peanuts juice and water was served. Inbound: A321 - Check in smooth flight was delayed by 20 mins and received the revised time SMS well in time Flight took off as per revised schedule again crew was attentive friendly and responsive although same thing was served for snacks. Overall a good experience and would recommend.
985,I flew from Amritsar to London via Delhi on flight AI115. Early morning departure from Amritsar with 2 hour stop over in Delhi then it was 7am when we took off from Delhi. The flight to Delhi was 50 mins on an airbus A321. Was given juice and a snack. No complaints. On the international leg it was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The flight was brilliant. I cant complain. The leg room was great (I flew economy). Even when the person in front reclines their seat it isn't uncomfortable. The IFE was excellent. Fast and easy to use. Plenty of movies to choose from mainly Bollywood with a few regional choices too. Maybe not so great on the Hollywood selection. The breakfast wasn't the greatest but for airline standards it was ok. Later in the flight lunch was served. It was lovely. I had the non veg option. It was chicken rice and also saag. It was probably one of the best airline meals I've had. The crew were well presented and hospitable. The flight was ahead of schedule too. Plane was spotless. I would definitely recommend Air India.
986,The service offered was very poor. There was no entertainment at all. I travelled from Hyderabad to Delhi. The duration of flight is two hours. Service was unavailable during the entire journey. The food was not at all good.
987,Took a Heathrow - Delhi - Heathrow flight but return flight was horrible. It was an old plane with entertainment system broken. Cabin crew restarted the entertainment system 3 time with not affect. The remote was broken and could not switch on overhead light to read. Since the flight was full could not accommodate a different seat. Food was tasteless.
988,Travelled by AI to HYD. Aircraft was VT-SCB in the Indian livery. Plus points: Check in was a breeze. Flight departed on time. Minus points: Aircraft was unclean. Crumbs on the tray table the side panels looked as if the last time they had been cleaned was during the Airbus delivery. All that pax were given was 2 cheap pieces of biscuit. The spring rod from the seat pocket was broken and was poking my knee on for the entire flight. For a full flight I did not have an option to change my seat. Never again with Air India.
989,It was a BHX-DEL-ATQ return flight on the Boeing 787-8. I had read the comments thinking it was horrible but it turned out to be the opposite! An ordinary Meat Curry with Saag Aloo and Rice! Entertainment was impressive- Bollywood and a few Hollywood movies! A steward didn't give my wife a vegetarian meal! She gave her a Chicken Meal nevertheless another steward came and gave her a veg meal so it was okay!
990,Bangkok to Mumbai. We were travelling along with family. Horrible flight. Travelling period was 4 hours 30 min. Entertainment system was not working at all. Staff on the board was not cooperative. It was a horrible experience.
991,Udaipur to New Delhi. The flight left 30 minutes early - I hope everyone was on board. The flight attendant's were vey good but we did not eat the meal. The other 6 business class passengers who were Indian asked what the meal was and would not eat it. Overall the flight was comfortable and we would fly Air India domestically again.
992,Bom-Jaipur-Bom on A319. I was surprised to receive breakfast outbound and snack inbound. There was no choice and they only served tea/coffee/water as beverages but what they served was pretty good. The cabin attendants were pleasant legroom was good. There was seatback IFE but it appeared to only have one channel playing some Bollywood farce. Both flights were quite good for a short domestic hop.
993,Travelled 11th April 2014 was very disappointed with the delay we faced at LHR 6 hours delay due to technical problems with the new dreamliner 787. Not happy with leg space I was expecting something a bit more sophisticated not nice experience for those who are broad and tall. Had problems with entertainment system on the way to DEL and on the way back to LHR crew were friendly. Sorry Air India but first and last.
994,BOM-DEL-SYD we reach domestic airport by 7 am to beat Mumbai traffic to catch our 10 am flight since we were FFM there is seperate queue at domestic airport and queue was small and quick The check in staff was not all courteous. We requested in case we can be pushed up on earlier flight to Delhi for which he asked us to pay extra for changes so we continue with our original booking. Flight boarding from Mumbai was slow and eventually took off 50 minutes late and hence reach Delhi at 12.45 for our connection flight to Sydney departing at 13.25. DEL staff were prompt to receive us and took us to transfer desk and immigration and finally get our security clear and put us on our flight at such a short transit time. due to delay we could not enjoy new Delhi airport. Flight from Delhi departed on time flight was light so staff made announcement for passenger to move and spread out in aircraft if they wish and occupy empty rows good meal courteous staff cabin was clean few toilets were smelly - wish they do something to keep them clean on long flight decent entertainment.
995,Melbourne to Delhi. The new Dreamliner 788 is a great plane a lot quieter more room to move about cleaner air and large windows. Left and arrived early. Business class half empty so the service was very good not quite as good as the Asian airlines but more than satisfactory. Seat comfort was fine and the lay flat bed made sleeping easy. The entertainment was good watched 2 movies in English. Ordered special food which was my mistake and cannot blame the airline for the disappointing food. The snack between meals (smoked salmon) was most enjoyable. The extras included a nice travel suit better than Qantas pyjamas duvet and pillows were comfortable and travel socks and eye masks supplied. Second leg Delhi to London plane service and entertainment as good as the first flight. Food. Gave up on my special meals and ordered from the menu. Breakfast (Poached eggs) was fine and the dinner (Supreme of chicken) served just prior to arrival as good as any meal I have had on a plane. Fresh fruit to finish. Extras - none which for a 9 hour plus flight was surprising bnot even travel socks.
996,Short haul flight from Trivandrum to Chennai. Pleasantly surprised by the condition of the aircraft which was a new one. The crew were efficient and friendly. The flight was on time and there were no time discrepancies on arrival either. Since it was a short haul flight snacks were offered. There is always room for improvement like the inflight entertainment. Overall I was pleased and would definitely consider flying Air India again.
997,Mumbai - Jeddah and back. The flight to Jeddah was a hopping service from Mumbai to Hyderabad and onto Jeddah. Aircraft was an old 747-400 piloted by an all women cockpit crew. Aircraft though old was neatly maintained. Served with a light snack on the Mumbai-Hyderabad sector and a full meal on the Hyderabad-Jeddah sector. Cabin crew curt but efficient. Decent selection of in-flight entertainment though some of the touchscreens were not working. Return was a direct flight to Mumbai. Aircraft was a 777-300. Neatly maintained. Efficient cabin crew. There was a slight delay in take -off due to a temporary runway closure at Jeddah airport but the captain was prompt to keep the passengers informed of the status. Decent in-flight entertainment system and a good hot dinner served. Air India looks to be improving its quality of service by the day.
998,Flew in March 2014 LHR-CCU-LHR via Delhi. Outbound flight was Dreamliner new flight and good food/drinks service was excellent. DEL-CCU was also good as well. On my way back faced little bit of hassle at CCU airport re baggage x-ray CCU-DEL service was good but were not satisfied with DEL-LHR leg no choice of drinks and also no wine video entertainment was not working properly arrived London Heathrow ahead of time though. Service should be improved on DEL-LHR sector.
999,My mother left on AI 43 MAA-DEL connecting AI 101 DEL-JFK on May 2 2014. Flight was slightly delayed from Chennai. She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!
