0,"  Had one of the worst experiences being a frequent flyer. Our flight from Bangkok arrived 20 minutes prior to the expected time. Collected our baggage, went through customs and other formalities just to reach the Domestic Air India counter to find out that our flight was delayed departure by 2 hours and the airport staff went let us go to the Departure Gates area as our Boarding procedure was pushed coz of the delay too. Me along with my wife and 2 kids had to unwillingly wait at the International exit where none of the few charging sockets were working and the sitting are was so crowded that restless passengers had to sleep on the floors (I'm sure many others would agree to seeing this happen) Spent 3 hours sitting on the seats with eyes full of sleep and tiredness. I assume that airlines are treating passengers according to their places of arrival and dominate passengers coz of the routes being less favorite by Delaying flights unnecessary etc. I'm shocked how a key player like Air india act so unprofessionally after being in business for a very long time. Disappointed to the core.","  Had one of the worst experiences being a frequent flyer. Our flight from Bangkok arrived 20 minutes prior to the expected time.

3," Worst planes I have ever been in while taking an international flight. I took same flight from Melbourne to Delhi with in a span of two weeks and both times flight was same. Flight entertainment didn't work both times even though it is direct flight for 12.5hours, Mobile charging USB plugs didn't work and Flight crew went to sleep after serving breakfast. You can imagine the torture of sitting on tiny seat with no entertainment, no mobile phone and no service. When I raised concern with customer care, they first promised to fix it by giving me 200 FFF points but then I said I prefer better service and I am happy to donate my points, then they offered me 25% of of the total flights I took. But no, nothing was given. I sent emails twice to see progress but after 3 months, nothing has been done.

5," Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in."," Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug.

7,"  I took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate. The online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly. Boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger A321 for this sector. I had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see. Also surprisingly on this flight sector I had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich. I had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good. Landing and arrival into BLR was also well ahead of time. However when the time came to collect the baggage, I had noticed that again the new bag tag which I had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that I had just purchased recently and put. Even last week when I travelled from Kolkata to Mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off, so it seems that Air India is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into. But other than that, this was a welcome flight and I am hoping that the next time I travel, they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give.","  I took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate.

12,"  As I had booked this flight at a discount rate, I was a bit anxious about whether I would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally. To my surprise, I didn't have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass. The flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats. For breakfast I opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam, sev upma, a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good. However, during the beverage service, I noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didn't bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise. Perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasn't good. Arrival to Mumbai was on time however I had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage, my baggage name tag that I had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in January too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into.

13," I travelled in direct flight from Toronto to Delhi with my brother on 26 June 2023. The entire plane smelled like public washroom. It was so disgusting.

Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest.

22," I had the opportunity to travel on AI flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to India. I haven't been adventurous enough to try them out international as I've heard my share of horror stories. I'm going to base my review on the 2 Pune-Delhi flights I've taken in this period. Booking: AI fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines. AI is full service. Which means 25 kgs of check-in luggage and meals served on-board. A huge win right away. Online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites. Rating: 10/10 Check In: The check-in counter for AI literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones. That did make me somewhat nervous the first time. As it turns out eventually, the flights both times were completely full so I have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at check-in. Maybe fewer flights? Nevertheless, the check-in agent was quick, efficient, polite, addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate. I was out and about in no time - both times. No complaints. Rating: 10/10 Boarding: Boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled. On both the flights I took. However the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time. Rating: 8/10 Crew: On both occasions, the cabin stewards / stewardesses were polite, efficient and thoroughly professional. Albeit the first flight, they weren't overly keen to smile. On the second flight, they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please. A very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience. 10/10 The craft: This was an older A320. Not the Neo version. Strangely, there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and I had (non working) screen controls. None of the others did. I guess, they reused some seats from other aircraft. The seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers. At 5ft7, I had decent enough knee room. But the seat width - that was definitely a bonus. Wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights, but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer A350s and B787s. That made a huge impact and I did not have to fight it out with my co-passenger for rights over the arm rest. Of course, the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics. But it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting. Rating: 7/10 Meals: Dinner was served. Chicken korma with rice and some veggies. Some yoghurt and a brownie cake. Was decent fare. Served with steel cutlery. Thank you AI! International carriers make note, it's criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery. Why do you do it? The cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and I did a stress test, it was actually quite rigid and strong. Well done. Service was quick and as efficient as how I was getting used to by now. 8/10 Punctuality: Both times on AI, the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached New Delhi 30-35 mins ahead of schedule! I repeat - 30-35 mins ahead of schedule. On a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs!! This is serious WOW. Super impressed. 10/10!

My daughter was super excited to go to USA and she said I will watch TV and play games to kill the time since she is not comfortable with long travel. Our seat number was good. To our shock, the seat was completely broken, no headphones were working, the touch was off and the button to adjust the seat was also broken. So, just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours. I am taking Air India off my list now, never ever travelling back in Air India again. We complained to the Air Hostess, she said, ""Yeah can't help it, I will reboot the system, there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you"" but she did not do anything. I felt like jumping off the flight, my daughter was crying for the screen to play some games but I was so helpless. Air hostess doesn’t have a smiley face, they were in a angry face and we couldn’t feel to ask anything if we need.","  We had a flight AI127 from New Delhi to Chicago on June 2023.

34," Air India has very poor customer service onboard the aircraft. No flight attendant came to even offer water after 3-4 hours. Snacks were given before the beginning of the flight. In 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided, there was also no warm food. Customer service is getting worse day by day. Everyone expected that since Mr. Ratan Tata took over Air India, he would make necessary steps to improve customer service, make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including TV screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved. It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto. I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight? This is ridiculous and I hope my message reaches the right authority in India to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport. If I still had option for travelling with Jet Airways, I would never ever travel with Air India. Sadly, Jet Airways is no longer active."," Air India has very poor customer service onboard the aircraft. No flight attendant came to even offer water after 3-4 hours.

37," Can an airline be this inefficient! From beginning to end! AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time.

43," One can keep writing a negative review endlessly if unluckily he has traveled by Air India, but I'll keep it short, and here is my review: The flight was delayed by 5 hours. Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food, I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore. Best of luck to those who still want to try flying with Air India."," One can keep writing a negative review endlessly if unluckily he has traveled by Air India, but I'll keep it short, and here is my review: The flight was delayed by 5 hours.

53,"  This was a flight that I had to take early morning due to the alternatives having much higher fares especially over weekends. The check in for the flight and the ground experience was quite good and even the flight boarding started on time for what seemed to be like a 90-95% full flight. The staff at check-in offered me seat 4F at the front that had no other seats in front of them which resulted in extra legroom. Pushback started on time and once airborne the breakfast service commenced and I had opted for the non veg course that consisted of an omlette, chicken sausage with spinach and hash browns. along with a croissant and yoghurt. The meal itself was pretty good. However one thing that I had noticed which was not appreciated was the fact that the tray table was not properly cleaned. The landing happened on time and I had no difficulty in getting my luggage. Overall for the price that was paid, this was actually a very good flight. Thanks to the crew and team.","  This was a flight that I had to take early morning due to the alternatives having much higher fares especially over weekends.

59,"  I boarded a flight from JFK to BOM on Monday, May 1st. The flight was scheduled to take off at 10:45 AM but was delayed until 5:20 PM (nearly 7 hours). Everyone had to deplane. Air India only provided each of us a $15 meal voucher for the long delay. On my way back to JFK from New Delhi on Thursday, May 18th at 2:20 AM, I asked an Air India check-in rep if he could upgrade me to business class. He said no because all the seats have already been taken. When I boarded and got off that flight, I saw that wasn't the case. I decided to submit a case on the Air India website and then was prompted to email [email protected]. I sent them an explanation on Friday, May 19th detailing all the inconvenience that was caused. Surprisingly, they replied to my email on the same day saying that they have ""shared details with the concerned airport"" and once they receive a response, they will get back to me.  I never received a response from them ever again. I requested a follow-up on May 29th, May 30th, and finally June 6th via email. I also called Air India on June 6th, but the rep kept asking me for my ticket number. I informed him that I've already flown and do not remember my ticket number. I asked him how I can find out this number. He didn't provide any assistance. Instead, he only repeated himself and decided to hang up. Very frustrating.

The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience.

94,  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline. They simply said we cannot help you. ,  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India.

All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation.

I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat!

I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight. I was not looking for the fancies, but basic amenities would have been appreciated for the amount of money I paid.

122," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises. The fare was reasonable for this one-way flight. However during check-in I was surprised to see that Air India has started charging for seat selection. This was never the case before as before it got privatized, we were able to select any seat of our choice without having to pay an additional fee for the same. And as Air India is a full service carrier ideally one should not be having to pay extra for this. The baggage drop at the airport was pleasant and done with no problems. The boarding started on time and the crew was also welcoming on board. However one thing I did not like was the fact that we had to wait in the bus for almost 15 minutes before the staff allowed us to board the flight as they wanted the previous batch of passengers to settle down before allowing us on board. Also as this was an evening flight, the crew provided snack options of both veg and non veg which was much appreciated with steel cutlery which is definitely an upgrade as previously the airline used to offer only vegetarian fares onboard domestic flights. Also for the veg option pav bhaji with a potato salad was offered and for the non veg option there was chicken tikka with pasta and salad along with tea / coffee. The food was quite good except for the pasta which was more on the sticky side. The flight landed on time and the crew was quite nice and overall the inflight service was quite nice. Air India has made great strides especially when it comes to the punctuality of their flights and streamlining and improving frequencies and also bringing back non veg onboard flights, however there are still certain aspects especially on the ground and the charging of the seats that can and should be improved."," After the last 2 experiences of travelling aboard an Air India flight, I was cautious about flying this sector as I did not want any unforeseen surprises.

More of that please! Said no one ever. Food was disgusting. Options: Veg or non-veg? Could you please specify? You know what, I rather don't want to hear.

I believe it is overdue for an upgrade. The seats are comfortable but do not recline to a flat bed, they just reach an angle that is not all that comfortable for sleeping.

157,"  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India. I flew on the 23rd of Nov 2022 from Heathrow to Delhi and then Delhi to Ahmedabad. My flight to Heathrow to Delhi was disappointing. I paid extra to sit at the front of the plane by the window only to find out that the entertainment system was not working. I told the flight attendant twice. She then said she will reset the system. Although that didn’t work so I told her again and she said there is a spare seat at the back of the plane where I can sit.  How can I get up and leave my seat when I’m blocked in by a sleeping elderly couple.  Why did I pay extra money for a specific seat when air India can’t even check that they flights are adequately maintained. Secondly, hygiene on these flights is horrendous I opened the pocket up to place a bottle of water there and there was still used tissues! There were sticky stains on the side which I wiped off with a baby wipe. I would like to think that airlines would be more regimented in ensuring there planes are cleaned to a certain standard especially after the pandemic we have been through. Funnily enough whilst waiting for my bags to be collected a gentlemen who also flew from London but first class on the first flight was equally as appalled with hygiene and service and stated that he may as well have sat in economy. Now I have just returned from India to Heathrow with my mother again via Air India and what a disappointment again. Flew on 13/11 from Ahmedabad. Our whole row had no entertainment system working despairing multiple reboots. No alternative seating was offered so being stuck on a plane staring at a welcome screen for 9.45 hours . I think you can now understand when I say although my fare covers my travel there is also a level of customer service expected which is just dire. The planes are outdated and customers are just expected to deal with things that are not there fault. Now for the next piece of resistancé. My younger sister is due to fly tomorrow I also funnily enough booked her flight over 2 months ago with Air India. We were completing her online check in only to find out that she had been changed onto to a different flight. Original travel was LHR TO BOM AND THEN BOM TO INDORE with a 4 hour lay over. We had the option to pay a cheaper price but with a 17 hour layover. But opted to pay extra to avoid waiting. So anyways we are checking her in online and her flights completely changed from a 4 hour layover to 11 hours. No emails received about this change. We received multiple about her return being changed. I call up the customer service desk and speak to a guy call Soham. Who was so confusing. I would like to suggest providing more training on effective communication and level of English to your call centre staff. Soham informed me that the original flight had been cancelled. WHY WAS THIS NOT MADE CLEAR IN WRITING. after a good 25 minutes Soham clarified that only option is LHR TO DEL and wait for 11 hours and then DEL to INDORE.  Why is it not being made clear to your customers about upcoming flight changes. If my sister wanted to wait 11 hours at an airport she would have paid less money. This specific fare was paid so that we can avoid waiting. In conclusion I’m sure you can understand my level of frustration of several occasions.","  I recently decided to travel with Air India to India and I must say I am severely disappointed and definitely will NOT be booking again with Air India.

159,"  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning. Flight from Mumbai to Delhi was first delayed 3 hours after take off time causing several passengers to miss the connection. Then we were made to leave the gates, collect our baggage and sit around at the airport until they figured out what they wanted to do, giving us no information and no compensation. Finally, about 6-7 hours of no communication later we were told that our flight would leave the next day, and we would have to find our own accommodation in Mumbai. Not only were they completely unapologetic about the situation resulting in a 2 day delay in our travel plan and a crazy 15 hour layover in Delhi, they expected us to find a place to stay overnight on our own and told us they would put us in business class for the trip but put us in economy and asked us to leave. Tried calling the call centre to clear it up and they hung up on me mid sentence, tried to speak to someone online but the bloody website doesn't work. This has essentially ruined what was a pretty good trip up to this point. Never again.","  Was supposed to fly Air India from Mumbai to Melbourne via Delhi with a 2 hour layover yesterday morning.

161," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays. The crew were welcoming and the flight got delayed due to the traffic conditions in Mumbai. One point to note here is that Air India does not provide full meal services on flights that are less than 2 hours. So what we had on this segment was just a vegetarian sandwich which was fine. However the real issue started when it was observed that my baggage was not present upon arrival. After inquiring about the same I was informed that the baggage would be coming as part of the evening flight but there as another morning flight which was present so was not sure why the baggage was unable to get delivered there on that flight. The staff there helped me to file a property irregularity report which helped me locate the bag and also get it delivered to my address in 24 hours without any damage. The last 2 times I traveled on Air India they were not positive experiences. The first one was when I had got a boarding pass for a flight I was unable to travel on as it was overbooked and this time the issue with the baggage. There was another passenger who was in the same situation regarding the lost baggage. This does not reflect well on the new owners. Hope that they can sort these things out on the ground because on the flight the crew were great and we all know about the plans to refurbish the cabins. But these sorts of incidents they really need to get a grip on because this could have the potential to put off passengers. I have already had 2 negative experiences travelling on the airline within the space of 2 months."," This early morning flight was taken at a reasonable rate and as it was almost full economy, I had submitted my baggage and rushed to the gate to get my flight as most airports in India and indeed the world have huge lines of people nowadays.

170,"  Worst experience of my life. I paid more than $1500 to get to India from the US even though there were flights for $900. The reason is that Air India had a non-stop flight from the US. I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away. The food was horrible, the seats were horrible and had very little room, non of the screens worked and, even worse, none of the outlets that are in planes for recharging your device worked. When I ran out of battery on my iPad I tried to read but the light did not work in my entire row.

173," I was booked on a waitlist flight from CCU to BOM this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising. I had resigned myself to not getting any seat on the flight as it was pretty full but then at the last moment the supervisor managed to print my boarding pass and I believed that I was actually going to fly onboard the flight. Or so I thought. After clearing the serpentine security line I rushed to the boarding gate hoping to catch my flight. And that is when a big surprise was up in store for me where it was revealed by the boarding gate agents that I would be unable to board as a regular pax had taken my place. This was pretty jarring, especially at the last moment. So I then had to make my way back to the check in desk to retrieve my luggage which had to be offloaded from the flight. The point here is why was the boarding pass issued to me when there was no guarantee that I would get a seat onboard the flight? If the staff had informed me that there are no seats I would have understood and resigned myself to that fact. Instead by printing my boarding pass it gave me a false sense of hope which was clearly not correct. The purpose of me writing this review is not to bash anyone but to highlight there there are certain aspects of waitlist bookings that should be handled better here. I may also have to reconsider going for waitlist bookings with the airline if this practice continues. And in this regard, Air India dropped the ball here big time. I hope that the airline takes the feedback onboard here regarding this."," I was booked on a waitlist flight from CCU to BOM this morning which was pretty much overbooked especially in mid week which was surprising.

180,"  This year, due to a family emergency, we needed to travel to India urgently and we reluctantly booked an Air India flight in economy due to the lack of other viable options. The check in staff at Melbourne were pleasant, helpful and efficient. We had to queue but the line kept moving. The ground staff member was cheerful and upbeat and really seemed to enjoy talking to people and took pride in his job. Our boarding was on time and orderly and our flight departed exactly on time. The highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew.  During the twelve hour flight, our cabin crew were absolutely delightful: They looked happy and we had a nice chat about the Indian wines being served on Air India during the bar service. They emanated a sense of warmth and caring. The professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced. We enjoyed the food very much also: Very nicely seasoned. We can see that the aircraft interiors are looking a little tired but we understand that a programme of refurbishment is underway.","  This year, due to a family emergency, we needed to travel to India urgently and we reluctantly booked an Air India flight in economy due to the lack of other viable options.

190," I had found this fare which came at a discount and thought of considering it. The check in was done properly and the last time I travelled on the airline post the Tata takeover, they had reduced the meal service so was skeptical over what the meal service was going to be like on this flight because the last time I travelled, only a sandwich as provided. The boarding started on time however the pushback got delayed by 30 mins due to the congestion at Mumbai airport which is the norm. I was also pleased to note that the ground staff offered me an extra legroom seat which was greatly appreciated. For the breakfast service I was pleasantly surprised as they were offering full breakfasts with both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian fares whereas previously only vegetarian was offered. The cutleries stainless steel instead of plastic which was a great touch. For the vegetarian fayre, it consisted of idlis, poha, croissant as well as mango yogurt along with tea / coffee which was great. The arrival was delayed by 30 minutes. But overall this was great value for money as I had got an extra legroom seat, a full breakfast with steel cutleries and good staff and crew service. I will be flying the return leg soon and I'm confident of receiving similar service. So much appreciated."," I had found this fare which came at a discount and thought of considering it.

The aircraft seats were torn, and dirty, and the handrest and other parts of the seat were held together with fraying masking tape. The cabin partitions and carpet were covered with grime. The flexible arm of the display wouldn’t stand up, and the wired remote was broken and temperamental. The Upma & Vada served for breakfast was undercooked and stale. The bread roll was cold and tough as a rubber pad. Food didn't get any better on the 12-hour flight. Snacks were meagre to non-existent.

223,"  I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 27 Jun 2022. Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.  The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces. ","  I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 27 Jun 2022.

244,"  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience.","  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show.

248,"  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.","  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class.

252,"  Visakhapatnam to Delhi. Air India is the worst airline and a big shame to our country. Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

253,"  Myself and my wife were supposed to fly to Leh from Delhi this morning. After showing up to our flight at 4:45am (2 hours before the departure) we've been told by the airline staff that we could not fly because of overbooking. We've been told that we would need to find an alternative means of transport. This was at the check-in counters. After challenging it and asking to be rebooked to another flight they said there was nothing they could do. When we showed up at the service counter, they told us that we were late for our flight which simply was not true. The flight was indeed overbooked. The staff were extremely rude, unhelpful and unapologetic. On top of not being able to get to our destination, we now have to fight for a refund.

260,"  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again.

The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart.

261,"  My husband and I were traveling on AI126 on 07 April 2022 when we left a tablet. We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything). The machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it. No communication about it at all.","  My husband and I were traveling on AI126 on 07 April 2022 when we left a tablet.

267,"  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.","  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22.

The phone# and email that I received from the baggage claim form is useless. Air India do not value their customers. No one will follow up regarding missing bags. After 50 phone calls and numerous emails with no response, we ended up going back at the airport three times, finally we had some luck with meeting with supervisor. After one long week, we received the bag. No compensation was provided for the troubles that we went through. It was the worst experience from our last travel.

This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working.

283,"  I travelled in AI 309 Melbourne to New Delhi. It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping.

Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping.

284,"  I am horrified! I've never been treated so badly in my entire life! I showed up for my flight 3 hours early. When I went to check in, I was asked if I had filled out the Air Suvidha form. I had not, as I had not been notified by Air India that this form was required, and I looked all over their website and found no mention of this form. I have been to India 4 times before and knew to have all my pertinent documents with me, which I did, but nobody told me I had to upload them to a special website. Filling out the form was impossible to do on a cell phone, I couldn't get the documents to be small enough, so the form kept being rejected. There was nobody there helping all the people who had not filled out the form because none of them were notified in advance. There were a half dozen of us that were not permitted to check in because we were unable to complete the form on our cell phones, among those turned away were an elderly couple and a young couple with an infant baby. This is totally unconscionable! The couple with the infant baby asked if they could at least be compensated with a hotel room, and the heartless Air India employee behind the counter said, sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Then to add insult to injury, when trying to rebook the flight, Air India is charging a $300 no show fee. This airline doesn't care in the least about customer service. I will never book a flight with Air India again. Do yourself a favor and book with a different airline.","  I am horrified! I've never been treated so badly in my entire life!

286,"  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.","  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route.

290,"  We had purchased a business class seat for my mother as she recently had major surgeries and her legs needed to stay elevated throughout the journey. The seat recline didn't work the entire time, the seat was normal as an economy class. The main reason for us to buy the Biz class for the comfort of her travel which was not the case here at all. I have try calling AI since last three days no answer. If you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up. I have submitted an online feedback no respond. I have sent an email no response. We were told by the crew member that since she had an issue with her seat she would get a refund back, but how will one get a refund if there is no way to contact anyone?

291,"  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.","  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st.

307,"  I flew Air India on a single-leg domestic flight of less than an hour. Unfortunately Air India lost my luggage on this flight. While I understand that accidents like these happen on any airline, Air India's customer support has been absolutely pathetic ever since. Calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either don't work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods. The specific phone numbers I received to the team handling my case at Goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages (even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number, so I strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number). At this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag, and a week since I last managed to get through to Air India (despite daily attempts to do so). In short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating, and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage. Apart from not having much confidence in Air India trying to return my luggage to me, my attempts to get compensated for (1) additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and (2) for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well. I was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the Goa team, after which my case would get updated with them and I'd retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global Air India office. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back on this email address after a week, and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after I leave India is bonkers. In my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from Air India the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through Twitter, but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case. Concluding, I would advise everyone to avoid Air India at all cost as any circumstance in which you'd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating. While I would expect non-budget national carriers and Star Alliance members offer some basic level of service, this is not at all the case for Air India.","  I flew Air India on a single-leg domestic flight of less than an hour.

308,"  Recently I traveled with Air India and experienced a worst experience with this airline. We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family. Their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight. Now I can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years. The attitude of the staff is sinking this boat.","  Recently I traveled with Air India and experienced a worst experience with this airline.

310,"  I am Extremely disappointed with the ground crew staff of Air India at Ahmedabad airport. I was travelling on 12th Nov 2021 from Ahmedabad to Chicago via Delhi. My flight was at 7:35 PM and I was inside airport at 5:30 PM. The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule.

I was travelling on 12th Nov 2021 from Ahmedabad to Chicago via Delhi. My flight was at 7:35 PM and I was inside airport at 5:30 PM. The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule.

314,"  I had my first experience with Air India recently, and I have to say it has been up there as possibly the most disappointing experience I have ever had. In summary, if you have a choice - please choose another proper airline. This was a flight long haul from London to Bombay. The ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to Business Class using FR miles. Prior to flying I needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare. I wasted hours of my time trying to call them. I managed to get through to one person, who when I explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem, what’s the problem. Then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h. Very confusing that he would say that, and not try to help me, and not collect any of my personal details. I never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call, with the queue position going up and down like a yo-yo. Shocking, beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services, that really damages Air India’s credibility with me. Anyway I went to the airport, I was concerned about extra check during COVID times so I arrived 3.5 hours before departure. Air India refused to allow me to check in early, despite the Business Counter being in use by economy passengers. Now I know I was early, so partially my fault. However at one stage other BOM passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while I had to wait for be allowed to go to the Business Class check-in. By the time I checked in, there was one BOM economy passenger I recognised that reached the counter before me. Business Class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling, or add a little luxury. I travel in economy for personal travel about 99% of the time, as we all have bills to pay. However when I upgrade to business class, I expect to enjoy it and see the benefit. After this ordeal I was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at London Heathrow, luckily it was a Star Alliance lounge run by another airline, phew! I’m glad it wasn’t an Air India lounge, lest I would be subjected to further torture. At the boarding gate more fun and games I’m afraid. One giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk. This meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers, just one big line to wait in. More stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided. On the plane, as expected a tired cabin, outdated infotainment. The seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options. The infotainment screen was low resolution, and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as Etihad. The Business Class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight, such as 4-5h, not a 9+h flight. I will write a complaint to Air India.

323,"  One of the worst flight ever with the worst ever staff. We booked an air india flight to Goa, but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception. There was an 11 month baby with us. At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate. The air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasn't the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us. Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted. I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call. After 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side. While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down.

The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working.

Also, the air conditioning was not properly working on the ground. It was very suffocating after wearing mask and face shield. Air India is one of the two domestic airlines that provide hot meals.

343,"  After avoiding Air India for years, I was forced to spend my hard earned money on them for a round trip between IAD and MAA because of the Indian government forbidding sixth freedom traffic under the covid air bubble agreements. I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.","  After avoiding Air India for years, I was forced to spend my hard earned money on them for a round trip between IAD and MAA because of the Indian government forbidding sixth freedom traffic under the covid air bubble agreements.

349," On this flight from Kolkata to Bangalore, when I tried to do the web check in, I came to know that the flight got rescheduled by 2 hours which was unexpected and not exactly welcome as we were hoping to save some time. Also when doing the web check in, I was also surprised to see that the system was unable to recognize the PNR which was quite strange, however the mobile check in was successful and even though the timing of the flight was uncertain, just 1 day before the departure, the airline provided a confirmation of the flight timings via SMS. The baggage drop and ground process was quick and smooth. Boarding was on schedule and the departure was also slightly delayed by 15 mins due to the air show in Bangalore. However the crew made up for the time en-route. The airline has also resumed full meal service and lunch was provided which was a welcome addition. The meal was good and nice and we landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule which was good. The web check in experience could have been better and also the rescheduling was not exactly welcome but the inflight experience was quite nice and the crew was very good in looking after the passengers.

364,"  I had booked an Air India flight for the 23rd of June from Mumbai to Auckland and also had a confirmed ticket. And because of the Covid19 situation, After a lot of difficulty i found a domestic flight and flew from Bangalore to Mumbai to catch my flight. Unfortunately, i get to know they have rescheduled the flight to July 2nd after reaching there, and they didnt not bother to inform their passengers via mail or message about the same. They made me stand and wait for hours when i went to inquire and lied to me saying the flight had been cancelled and blamed it on the immigration. Many passengers like me who traveled to Mumbai, are stranded here and nowhere to go. Air India agreed it is their mistake and refused to provide any solution. Since we could not go out of the airport and had nowhere to go, we had to pay 9000rs per day and stay at the airport hotel for 9 days, total 72000rs (which was not affordable and we had to shell out all our savings). Air India has played with passengers emotions, made them waste lakhs of rupees, left them in helpless situations and separated them from families and left them alone to suffer. This is unacceptable and inhuman. Very rude staff at Air India counter in Mumbai.","  I had booked an Air India flight for the 23rd of June from Mumbai to Auckland and also had a confirmed ticket.

The booking process was smooth especially when you consider that during the covid-19 crisis, most carriers were busy cancelling flights,  however we noticed that Air India flights were operating and looking at the previous record of flights we decided to go ahead with them. The tickets were on the high side but in these times having an airline actually fly instead of cancelling the flight is a game changer. The boarding actually started well before the scheduled time and as there were lots of passengers flying, a Boeing 777 was used instead of the Airbus. There was no food on this flight and for those allotted the middle seats, we had to wear the PPE equipment provided by the airline. Departure and arrival were both on time. So bravo Air India for once again coming to the nations rescue not only during the Vande Bharat missions but also during these difficult times.

372,  I booked this airline for my parents to travel to India. The flight date is 27th May. The Airline canceled the flight due to COVID-19 and is giving us two bad options 1) Rebook the ticket and the travel has to finish before 31 Mar 2021. My parents can only go there during summer vacation. This summer vacation is gone... not enough time to rebook for the next summer. 2) Cancel the ticket and cancellation charges are $350/person. I asked can I just not show up and cancel the flight in June and the representative only mentioned that the cancellation charges then would be different but could not tell me how much different ... lower/higher/same/similar. So I'm paying $700 to AirIndia for canceling the flight on me and offering no reasonable alternative. Needless to say I had to wait a really long time on the customer service call. My queue position during the call went from over 90 to 11 to 15 to 19 and 17 and then I suddenly got a call. I have no clue why they bothered to even have a queue on the call. Their chatbot or automated service does not really work.,  I booked this airline for my parents to travel to India. The flight date is 27th May.

406,"  Colombo to Vienna via Delhi. Air India was by far one of the worst airlines, I flew with. It was a more or less cheap flight, so the food and drinks were ok, though the breakfast was not edible in my opinion (some sort of croissant with cream cheese and ketchup?). The staff was very unfriendly. When you asked for something, like a glass of water or some help with the screen in front of you, which didn't work at all, or froze in the middle of a film, they helped unwillingly. During the return flight to Delhi, we had 2 hours delay, we said to the staff before boarding that we had a transfer flight to Vienna and we couldn't miss it. They said, that they would take care of it, but they didn't! So in total 12 people missed the transfer flight and had to wait 24 hours in the Delhi airport until the next flight. They provided dinner and breakfast at one specific restaurant, but didn't organize any accommodations, nor did they give us any care products or blankets to sleep (let me tell you, it's very cold and loud in the Delhi airport). I don't recommend this airline, they treated us very poorly and we didn't get any compensation for the LONG wait.","  Colombo to Vienna via Delhi.

456,"  San Francisco to Delhi via Hyderabad. This was the first time I was flying Air India, and I have truly never used a worse mode of transportation ever. Air India has the worst aircraft with the most ancient entertainment systems. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days. This experience has definitely turned my family, friends and me away from Air India as future customers.","  San Francisco to Delhi via Hyderabad.

457,"  I booked my ticket in the UK with Southall travel. 2 days before my outbound flight to Delhi I telephoned Air India to reserve my seats. I was told that I now had reserved window seats on every one of my flights and there was no need to check in online. It was all done. I arrived at Heathrow and took my pre booked window seat to Delhi. On 14th April arrived at Delhi international airport at 09:50 in the morning to fly to Kathmandu. The flight was due to leave at 12:50. 3 hours later. I queued with my luggage for almost 2 hours. When I got to the check in desk I was told that Air India had over booked the flight so I would not be able to fly that day and would have to fly the following day. I protested and said that this would not do. I spoke to several members of staff and two managers. I was pushed from pillar to post. I demanded that Air India put me on the next available flight with whichever carrier they could. I was told that this would not be possible as the only other flight to leave that day was a Nepal Airlines flight which was already full. I persisted. Finally they called Nepal Airlines who agreed to put me on the flight if there was a cancellation and the 2 airlines would sort out everything between themselves. While I was waiting I questioned the Air India representative who informed me that it happens quite regularly and that every week at least one or two passengers do not get their seats due to Air India over booking their flights. He said that confirming seats for my future Air India flights by telephone was not a guarantee that I would get the seat because priority would be given to people who book their seats online and if I ever was to confirm my seat by telephone then Air India's policy is to advise customers to arrive at the airport to check in at least 4 hours prior to departure. The agent in the UK said nothing about this when I confirmed my seats with him. A seat came up with Nepal Airlines at around 14:35. I was told to hurry forward. I did so do with the Air India representative towards the Nepal Airlines check in desks. However when we got there the Air India Representive informed me that I would be liable for the excess baggage as Nepal Airlines allow only 20 kilos of luggage whereas my luggage allowance with Air India is 46 kilos. I refused to pay; It was not my fault that Air India over booked their flight so why should I, the passenger be penalised for their utter incompetence.

458," We had a awful trip from FFM to Colombo and back with Air India. We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are.

470,"  Washington to Delhi. I had a family emergency, so I bought whatever ticket was available. Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line! I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck. I recommend everyone to avoid this airline like plague. I am never flying with them again.","  Washington to Delhi. I had a family emergency, so I bought whatever ticket was available.

474," Mumbai to Newark. Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"".

476," San Francisco to New Delhi. Worst of the worst. Don’t fly Air India unless this is your only resort. 1) I was traveling alone with my twin 3 year old daughters. They offered no support during the flight. I smiled more than they did. 2) I asked the hostess for water upon boarding and she told me to look in the seat pockets. No such thing was found. The seats were in horrible condition when we arrived. No one had cleaned after the previous flight. 3) No inflight entertainment. Everything was broken. 4) Calling the hostess is a useless exercise. Don’t bother waiting. 5) The arm rests were broken and cracked dangerously enough to cause a hazard for little kids. They kept falling on them when they were trying to sleep. 6) They have nothing to offer little kids. No coloring sheets, stickers. Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving. When I complained, they simply said “You should’ve asked for it.” 8) When I whined about all this, one of the hostesses said that she’ll come and take a look.

479,"  Colombo to Kathmandu via New Delhi. Horrible experience from the start till the end. There were multiple changes to the flight schedule which disrupted our travel plans and we were provided ridiculous alternatives (we are transiting in Delhi and the new flight meant that our connecting flight would depart Delhi even before we arrive in Delhi- how is it even possible for us to catch the flight if we arrive in Delhi at 11am and the flight to Kathmandu from Delhi departs at 9?). So after a gruelling process of speaking to an agent we are offered new flights. This time around we had a one hour transit in Delhi which most travellers would agree is cutting it thin if you consider queues and other unpredictable scenarios. But as luck would have it, our flight from Colombo was delayed by over 30 minutes. We were slated for an 8.20am departure according to the ticket but when we spoke to the staff they told us it has been pushed to 850am. That leaves us with 30 minutes to transit? How can we possibly disembark, go through security and get to our new gate in this time? To make things worse. At 840 people were still disembarking from the plane which appeared to be a turnaround flight. This meant that the staff would still have to clean up the plane and it was evident that our flight would not depart punctually at 850- but at this point no announcements were made whatsoever, not even on the notice screens. Upon checking with the staff they told us it would depart at 905 instead. What on earth is happening? All this while the staff insisted that I would be able to make the flight even though I initially had a one hour transit and the original flight has now been delayed over 45 minutes. That leaves us with 15 minutes. Rather than providing us with helpful information, they gave us flimsy assurance that we would make it even though the odds were clearly against us. This uncertainty is disconcerting for travellers who have actual plans that may need to be shelved if we actually miss the connecting flight. Air India needs to stop selling tickets they cannot guarantee and work on being on time. It makes no sense for a national carrier to be so flaky with their timing.","  Colombo to Kathmandu via New Delhi. Horrible experience from the start till the end.

Our flight from Paris to Delhi gets delayed. After customs and immigration the luggage drop off counter is a small crowded counter. No proper queues and Officers are the most rude people you will encounter. They at the last moment before dropping our luggage asked us to check in the liquor bought on duty free. We had to take out clothes from our bag and put bottles inside on the counter which was badly crowded and unprofessionally managed.

496,"  Chicago to Chennai via New Delhi. My initial flight from Chicago to New Delhi got delayed couple of hours because of delayed start. I had only couple hours for my connecting flight at New Delhi.

I was told at Chicago that I will be provided with a hotel and asked me to talk to Air India people at New Delhi for allotment. When I reached New Delhi, I was told that they do not have any hotel but can provide me with lounge access which has beds to sleep and fresh up. I was provided with a complimentary dinner from Dilli Street restaurant inside the domestic terminal. But when I came to lounge to take rest I was told that there is communication for them to provide lounge access and we had to escalate this to a manager at New Delhi airport who in turn told me that they did not promise me any lounge access or beds. I was told to just stay at boarding gate.  This is my first time flying with Air India. When I mentioned the same with Air India agents they said that this always happens with Air India and the service is not that great with Air India. When I spoke with manager and asked them ""Shouldn't they be providing accommodation for delays from Air India and is this how you treat passengers?"" Her reply was you can interpret that in any way but I cannot help you in any way except for asking you to wait at departure gate. Entertainment system in international flight did not work for my co passenger. I had to switch seats and we had to take turns to watch movies.

The food provided was excellent (breakfast of egg omelette with sausages, croissant, butter, jam, coffee/tee), lunch consisted of three choices (lamb, chicken, vegetarian). The chicken came with rice and vegetables with a separate side salad and desert, all of which was tasty and of good quality. On top of this there were two drink-runs and before landing they provided another sandwich. The seat was good (admittedly I forked out for an exit row which I then was happily able to have the whole row to myself), legroom good enough for a giraffe. The only very minor minus points were the not-working global map and a rather limited selection of new films. The crew was responsive and courteous and happy to assist.

The boarding started 1 hour 15 minutes after the original departure time. The load was quite full for this flight as there were many office goers who were returning back from work. Dinner was served on this flight which consisted of a vegetarian fare of mixed vegetables and dal rice followed by gajar halwa and dahi vada for dessert. The food on Air India's flights has always been sumptuous and this is one of their main USP's. Landing was of-course delayed but the disembarkation and baggage retrieval was done very swiftly. The flight in itself was very comfortable and even though it was delayed, it ensured that I was able to make the flight on time although flight delays is something that is still affecting Air India and unless and until they can find a way to resolve these issues, the airline will be at a disadvantage as compared to other rival carriers.

Reached the destination fresh which was very important during this long haul flight. Thank you Air India for such a wonderful flight. Air India may not be a luxurious airline but it is much much better than what people think. For anyone travelling to the west coast, I would highly recommend this product as it provides great value for money and reduces the travel time considerably.","[('return', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('San', 'n'), ('Francisco', 'n'), ('Delhi', 'n'), ('scheduled', 'v'), ('late', 'a'), ('night', 'n'), ('departure', 'n'), ('quite', 'r'), ('empty', 'a'), ('ensured', 'v'), ('would', None), ('sufficient', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('stretch', 'v'), ('sleep', 'v'), ('.', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('departed', 'v'), ('time', 'n'), ('epic', 'n'), ('18', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('eastwards', 'n'), ('.', None), ('crew', 'n'), ('helpful', 'a'), ('assisted', 'v'), ('lot', 'n'), ('.', None), ('3', None), ('meal', 'n'), ('services', 'n'), ('offered', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('(', None), ('refreshments', 'n'), ('/', 'v'), ('lunch', 'a'), ('/', 'n'), ('dinner', 'n'), (')', None), ('including', 'v'), ('alcoholic', 'a'), ('/', 'n'), ('non', None), ('alcoholic', 'v'), ('beverages', 'n'), ('ensured', 'v'), ('satisfaction', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Throughout', None), ('flight', 'n'), (',', None), ('able', 'a'), ('rest', 'v'), ('comfortably', 'r'), ('even', 'r'), ('able', 'a'), ('watch', 'v'), ('movie', 'n'), ('two', None), ('good', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Pakistani', 'n'), ('airspace', 'n'), ('still', 'r'), ('remained', 'v'), ('close', 'a'), (',', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('go', 'v'), ('Mumbai', 'n'), ('/', 'n'), ('Gujarat', 'n'), ('arriving', 'v'), ('Delhi', 'n'), ('yet', 'r'), ('flight', 'n'), ('still', 'r'), ('landed', 'v'), ('15', None), ('minutes', 'n'), ('ahead', 'r'), ('schedule', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Reached', 'v'), ('destination', 'n'), ('fresh', 'v'), ('important', 'a'), ('long', 'a'), ('haul', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Thank', 'v'), ('Air', 'n'), ('India', 'n'), ('wonderful', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Air', 'n'), ('India', 'n'), ('may', None), ('luxurious', 'a'), ('airline', 'n'), ('much', 'r'), ('much', 'r'), ('better', 'a'), ('people', 'n'), ('think', 'v'), ('.', None), ('anyone', 'n'), ('travelling', 'n'), ('west', 'n'), ('coast', 'n'), (',', None), ('would', None), ('highly', 'r'), ('recommend', 'v'), ('product', 'n'), ('provides', 'v'), ('great', 'a'), ('value', 'n'), ('money', 'n'), ('reduces', 'v'), ('travel', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('considerably', 'r'), ('.', None)]","  return flight San Francisco Delhi schedule late night departure quite empty ensure would sufficient seat stretch sleep . flight depart time epic 18 hour flight fly eastward . crew helpful assist lot . 3 meal service offer flight ( refreshment / lunch / dinner ) include alcoholic / non alcoholic beverage ensure satisfaction .

521,"  Delhi to Mumbai via Indore. After landing in DEL, as the airline had provided a very tight connecting flight from Delhi to Mumbai as a result of which that connection was missed. So the airline staff, had provided an alternate connecting flight but this was via Indore which added up to the travel time which was not exactly ideal. What was surprising was that the airline did not have any connecting flights to Mumbai from Delhi between 9am till 3pm. Because Delhi to Mumbai is usually such a trunk route that there are enough flights. So this was not very good. During the checkin of the flight, the check-in agent was very helpful and told us about the status of the flight including the seat availability and other details which was really helpful. The flight in itself was slightly delayed due to connecting passengers from Srinagar. From Delhi to Indore a light snack featuring a sandwich and a drink were provided which was good. After landing in Indore, we had to sit inside the aircraft as the servicing was done and other passengers joined in. For the remaining Indore-Mumbai leg, again a snackbox was provided and arrival was 30 mins delayed which was not preferable. It seems that Air India's international product is fabulous but on the domestic sector there can be improvements with regards to the frequency of flights / flight delays. The flights were pretty decent. Would recommend but would expect more connections and frequencies of flights because I had to wait almost 5 hours to get my connecting flight back to Mumbai and that also with a stopover.","  Delhi to Mumbai via Indore.

522,"  No matter how bad you think the Air India might be, it's actually going to be worse than that. I'm a multi-million miler, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a worse experience than 15 hours on Air India. Not all of it is the airline's fault--but if you connect from a domestic flight to leave from Delhi, you go through seven different ID and security checks before getting on the plane: everything from accessing the terminal to accessing the gate, each has its own separate security inspection. I'm not sure what terrible people they believe would pose a threat to an airline which needs no help falling apart. At the gate. We were delayed several hours for reasons unknown and unexplained. When we did board, there was immense disappointment. The seat cushion at my seat was clearly from a regional aircraft and did not fit the seat, It covered maybe 75% of the seat area, and the rest of me was sitting on the gap or directly on the metal seat frame. The entertainment system was non-functional. A 15 hour flight, and it was broken. But whatever, it's 4AM and we've been waiting almost four hours to leave. It's time to push back. And we're back to the gate. At least the pilot checked to see if we had fuel before taking off. Because apparently we didn't have enough. And refueling took another 40 minutes. That hardly seems like a top up because we idled the engines for too long. And now we're finally on our way. The food served was...pretty dreadful. The cabin crew did their best, but the condition of the aircraft wasn't their fault. However, the cleanliness of the aircraft was indeed their responsibility. By midflight, all but one lavatory had run out of toilet paper and paper towels. The one lavatory which hadn't run out of paper had an actual hole punched in the bottom of the toilet, and was covered in human waste as it could no longer flush. It was probably the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen, and even worse, there were no alternatives--waiting another 6 hours wouldn't end well for me. The ironic thing is that the inflight maps show the locations of famous shipwrecks as you fly over them--which serves as a reminder that there are some journeys that actually are worse than flying Air India. Change here needs to start from the top, and run through this organization like an avalanche. They'll need years of good reviews and quality results before I'd consider them again, but I don't think they'll have that luxury.","  No matter how bad you think the Air India might be, it's actually going to be worse than that.

Once airborne on this 17 hour flight, the crew regularly looked after the passengers with food and drinks at regular intervals. At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. I believe along with DEL-JFK, this flight is also one of Air India's best products as it reduces the travel time considerably and the service is warm and hospitable. Kudos to the crew for an amazing flight."," The second onward connection from Delhi to San Francisco was scheduled in the evening and on this sector surprisingly not all the seats were full as the airline has increased the frequency of flights to SFO.

528,"  Sydney to Delhi. What a way to celebrate the international womens day than spend 5 hours with mom at the Delhi customs office, where we literally left close to midnight. This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. This was my first and last experience with Air India My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together. There were a lot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response from Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago . Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection. After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building. The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another. Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. "" The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. The customs kept repeating that the Air India was not responding . However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a a scene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding , the server was working and the money was collected in cash. We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through. Finally, Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work. I do hope no one else goes through, what I went through I would not recommend anyone to use this airline after my experience.

541,"  Kolkata to Bengaluru in economy class was a comfortable and safe flight and even though the boarding and departure was delayed by 15-20 minutes due to air traffic. The pilots tried to make up for the lost time enroute on this 2 hours 10 minutes flight which was good but unfortunately we landed 40 minutes behind schedule.  For dinner, there was a good hot meal consisting of a paratha, dal makhni and panner masala with rice and a sweet dessert. The food quality was excellent and filling. The staff was cheerful with a good attitude. Overall, I would recommend the airline if one is looking for basic, solid service without too much glamour. The airline can certainly improve on it's OTP because that's where they are losing the perception edge as passengers believe other carriers are more reliable.

542," Air India from Bengaluru to Kolkata. This flight was the perfect example of when Air India gets everything right on this early morning flight to Kolata. From the self check in kiosks which printed the boarding passes to the flight itself which in fact departed on time and arrived 25 minutes well ahead of the scheduled arrival time. The flight was a very smooth flight with breakfast served consisting of an idli and upma along with fresh fruits and coffee which was very filling. Crew and staff were very quick and prompt in their service. Air India usually has problems when it comes to matters of reliability and OTP but on this occassion, they exceeded expectations and infact arrived well before time. The aircraft was among the newer 320s with sharklets and the seat was fresh and comfortable. Would like to thank the crew and staff for this flight."," Air India from Bengaluru to Kolkata.

San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi. This is the worst international airline I have taken ever.  The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service. Most of the IFE screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. ","

547,"  Me and my wife flew with Air India on the 1st February from Goa to Mumbai, Mumbai to Delhi and Delhi to Copenhagen. We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water. Additionally, our bags went missing so we had no clothes to change or any hygiene appliances with us.We had a very bad ending of our holidays because of Air India's staff incompetence.

548," We flew Business class from Delhi to Paris CDG on AI 143 on 01 Jan 2019. The entertainment system for the entire plane was out of order, and the crew knowingly departed with the information that the system was unable to load any content including the basic flight map. In addition, the seat functions did not work in Business class due to repeated hard restarts of the cabin by the crew. So, this business class day flight turned out to be a nightmare, and not what is expected from a Star Alliance member. The crew was very apologetic, and they told me the system was also faulty on the two previous flights to and from FRA on previous day. Your customer contact center sent the following feedback: “Sometimes such efforts may not be successful and can be rectified only on the return of the aircraft to the base station. We are extremely sorry, as this complimentary amenity could not be enjoyed by you. Please be apprised that the shortcomings have been brought to the attention of the Department concerned and the Airline has already initiated the process of rectifying these issues, which soon will be taken care of. Any shortfall in customer servces is once again”’ The entertainment system and a functioning seat is not complimentary. I pay for this service as part of the ticket. It is a basic service which you failed to provide. Especially in Business Class. No compensation provided at all by Air India. Flight was on time, food was rather poor (maybe on par with premium economy on other airlines), crew friendly but rather hopeless. Lounge in Delhi is horrible. Food is almost non existent and staff is rather arrogant.

And the seat controls are atrociously bad - its hard to figure out which way its actually moving and the grating jerky movements make for a poor customer experience. The meals served was mostly lukewarm or cold and the staff didn't seem to care. If this is the experience in business class, i really dread to think what the economy class must be like.

557,  Delhi to New York. Worst airline ever. We had to make an emergency landing at another airport and through incompetence and negligence waited 4 hours at another airport without food or water. Their mistakes made everyone miss their connecting flights which they refused to hold even though it affected hundreds of passengers. We waited over three hours at New Delhi airport just to get new boarding passes for flights 24 hours later.  All because they refused to pay another airline. No food or water for another 4 hours before forcing us to share airport hotel rooms with complete strangers. They refused to tell us what was going on which created chaos and much longer waits for everything. I now have to spend at least another additional 30 hours of traveling just to get home. Do not fly this airline!! It is not safe and you are treated like garbage with no customer service whatsoever. ,  Delhi to New York. Worst airline ever.

Fast forward into boarding and even though the departure time was 8.50am, we only started boarding after 9am. Then there was a further delay of around 1 hour in the aircraft pushback so the flight actually departed at around 10.40am which was not expected and disappointing. The Business Class seats in themselves were pretty good and the in-flight service was  exceptional with a welcome watermelon juice drink, crew being engaging, friendly and personable. For Breakfast, I had opted for the cheese omelet which tasted very good along with coffee and croissants.  The pilots tried to cover the lost time enroute which was admirable and soon after landing, disembarkation was smooth and the luggage was received swiftly and promptly. Air India is a pretty solid airline and compared to other carriers such as Jet or Indigo, it is pretty solid and stable, if there has been one thing that has been holding the airline back, it's the on time performance which has been lagging considerably behind it's competitors.

581,"  Delhi to Chicago. This was my first and last trip with this airline. Not only are the staff incompetent, they are not honest.

The first lie was a 2 hour delay, the second a 4 hour delay, and on the third 2 hour delay which then established a cumulative 6 hour delay - at least 60 male and female passengers were at the podium at gate 26B in the Delhi airport demanding answers or plans. Air India supervisors, who had no competence, leadership, organization, or plans were found to have lied to the passengers once one of the younger employees admitted they knew all along the flight was not coming. These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all.

583,"  Delhi to Bangkok. I found the business class staff to be exceedingly friendly and courteous and professional. Upon landing the Chief Purser came around and shook everyone’s hands, remembering names and thanking us for choosing to fly with Air India. The services were fine, with a choice of alcoholic beverages and pre-dinner snacks. The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its décor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look. Entertainment choices were ok, and the seats were generally pretty comfortable. All in all, a pretty good flight with a few drawbacks.","  Delhi to Bangkok.

589," Air India was actually excellent to my surprise, and heavily contrary to the views I have heard about it. I am a Star Alliance Gold member, and hence I was lucky to board with Business Class passengers. I thought I would fly with Air India in a domestic flight and it was great for Air India to join the alliance as passengers like me want an opportunity to accrue miles from star alliance flights. Check in was smooth, ground staff were courteous and kind at Coimbatore Airport and they even gave me a lounge pass for me and my mother, although there was no Air India contract lounge in Coimbatore Airport. Boarding was smooth and in a sequence with priority passengers first. Also, the crew greeted us well and the aircraft had clean interiors and clean lavatories. Food was excellent too. There's no Star Alliance carrier in North America (United/Air Canada) that offers complimentary meals on a domestic flight. Also, the legroom was excellent, especially for a person who is 6 ft 4 inches. The crew were very kind to offer my mother a blanket and some medicine when she felt sick. Overall, I enjoyed it. Hats off to Air India and hope they improve more even further! Only thing I suggest is at least provide in-flight wifi either for free or for purchase to not bore passengers."," Air India was actually excellent to my surprise, and heavily contrary to the views I have heard about it.

590,"  My experience with Air India was terrible. My family and I had to wait for more than 3 hours because the numbers on our tickets didn’t match theirs, even though we were still on their list of boarding passengers. Our tickets were issued from Turkish Airlines since we had a connecting flight from Istanbul, Turkey to Mumbai and then to Ahmedabad. We have previously dealt with this same situation when we were going from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, but when we called Turkish Airlines and explained this situation in front of the Air India staff, we were immediately given our tickets. However, this time, we had to pay for our tickets again. Air India was simply cheating us by making a huge deal out of a small mistake that they themselves have made with our tickets. We had to pay double the amount for our tickets only to recieve the same treatment and service. I would rate Air India zero stars if I could. I will never board Air India ever in my life.","  My experience with Air India was terrible.

591,  I had travelled on this morning flight from Mumbai to Bangalore on the A319. The web check in worked well and so was able to print the boarding pass in advance without any technical issues. The flight itself was a pretty full flight and the flight was delayed by 40 mins which was a tad disappointing but of no real consequence. The crew and staff were very friendly and courteous and were quite prompt to respond to requests. The seat was quite comfortable with great seat pitch which has to be one of the biggest plus points of the carrier. During the flight breakfast was also served which was good and filling followed by tea/coffee. Touchdown was very smooth and the disembarkation process and retrieving baggage was no hassle. Would not hesitate to fly again.,  I had travelled on this morning flight from Mumbai to Bangalore on the A319.

The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with Air India and will never do so in the future.

613," Singapore - Mumbai and New Delhi - Singapore. Singapore to Mumbai on the 787, entertainment was mediocre. No smiles from flight attendants who seemed to dislike their job. However this leg wasn't the big issue. New Delhi to Singapore was the big issue. Paid at the time of booking to select my seat and upon check-in at the airport, staff told me that the seat has been given to someone else. When I questioned him why this was so, he said ""Yes you have paid to choose that seat, but it doesn't mean it's confirmed."". When I argued further with him on this, he resorted to saying ""It's not my fault!"". On the plane, the tray table was horribly stained with curry. Had to ask the flight attendants countless times for help until I got a few napkins from them and had to clean it up myself. The flight attendant was irritated with me and started treating me rudely for the rest of the flight. Food was terrible as well. I am not picky with airlines, as long as they are decent. I have flown many different airlines from all six continents. However, Air India the one airline that is far from any acceptable standards and truly does not deserve the title of being a Star Alliance member. I've heard bad reviews before and I thought I could handle it. A joke of a national airline."," Singapore - Mumbai and New Delhi - Singapore.

620," New York to Mumbai via Delhi. The return leg of this flight was around 85% full however the service on this sector provided by the crew was excellent. The flight took off on time which was followed by refreshments/lunch service. The crew were very friendly and full of smiles during the service and after lunch the cabin was dimmed during the rest period. Regular food was offered and the quantity and quality of the food provided was excellent. The seat was fairly comfortable, although showing signs of age which is expected when it has been in service for over a decade. The IFE may not been as vast containing 42738 odd movies like some other airlines but it was adequate enough during the trip and I even managed to watch a couple of movies but was unable to sleep due to infants crying continously and parents unable to pacify their babies but I was still able to rest for 2 hours or so and arrival into Delhi was on time. The remaining leg from DEL to BOM was on the star alliance Boeing 777 which was cool and a hot snack was offered on this route. Landing was on time and baggage was delivered smoothly on the carousel. Thank you Air India for a comfortable trip replete with good service. Would not hesitate to fly with them again."," New York to Mumbai via Delhi.

623,"  Newark to Mumbai return. The plane was modern with adequate legroom between seats and seats were rather comfortable. The biggest problem I noted was that the Inflight Entertainment system were not working properly. I sat in one seat and noticed the jack for the headphones would not accept my personal noise cancelling headphones or even the airlines' own headphones. The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all. Otherwise the planes are modern with fair catering and flight attendants who do their job while not being friendly.

625,"  New Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata. First time flying with Air India. Was a bit excited when I found out I will be flying in the  Boeing 787-8  to Kolkata, and from there, connecting flight to Dhaka in an Airbus A319. Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom. The onboard served snack wasn't good on this one. There was dry, cold Singara and cake. The plane made some noises during the flight. This Aircraft, perhaps ,wasn't properly maintained. Anyways, landed in Dhaka after a 1 hr flight. Overall experience was really good.","  New Delhi to Dhaka via Kolkata. First time flying with Air India.

Each one was taking care of every customer. Most of the luggage lifting and its arrangement was done by them (unlike other airlines). Special care was taken of kids and elderly people. The airplanes have much spaced and are comfortable. (Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today. The ticket rates are competitive and sometimes cheaper than others.

633,"  Delhi to London. Earlier this month I reviewed the outbound sector of my trip, this review covers the inbound sector on the 31st January. Although the plane was a Boeing 787, it was quite an old one and hence badly maintained. The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew? I imagine not because otherwise these reviews would not be published.","  Delhi to London.

635," Flew Bangkok to Birmingham via Delhi. Never fly with Air India. I stated I had certain dietry requirements when I booked, also via email, the app and at check in. When I got my meals none of them suited my dietry requirements. I didnt eat for over 18 hours due to this. The staff were dreadful, when pressing the staff requirement button no-one came, you had to actually go to the back of the plane and interrupt their mothers meeting to which they were extreamly rude about. They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen.

637,"  London to Delhi. Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst.

Cabin crew attitude and their behaviour with passengers  leaves much to be desired. On three occasions they served drinks or food coming from behind rather from front, no eye contact, no smile, nothing. In the first serving they gave options of non-veg/veg/continental food but in the second serving only option was Indian food which was too spicy to be eaten by a person living in Europe. I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood.

664," I'm not sure if service on this sector has always been mediocre with Air India, but I am definitely less than satisfied with the service I was given from the airline on one of their most significant international routes. Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM.

All this for a fare that would make the cheapest European budget airline seem somewhat expensive.

671,"  London to Mumbai.  The departure was delayed a bit due to a medical emergency on the inbound flight.  Crew started drinks service accompanied by a pack of peanuts. Drinks included apple, orange juice, whiskey, water. As I opted for the veg option, the lunch consisted of paneer kofta with rice and vegetables with a bun, salad and kheer for dessert. The meal was quite tasty and filling which was good. Afterwards, the IFE kept me occupied for most part of the flight. The IFE was not expansive but for a 9 hour journey managed to keep me occupied. The crew dimmed the windows after lunch to make passengers get some sleep. Before landing, supper was provided which consisted of a samosa, veg cutlet and panner tikka with a bun, fruits and gulab jamun for dessert. Arrival in Mumbai was delayed by 35 mins. The seats were quite comfortable, the crew were a bit stiff but provided regular drinks. However, at the end of the flight the cabin area was a complete mess with blankets and debris all over the floor. Would travel with them again on this sector.","  London to Mumbai.

Flight stewards did their job, all boxes ticked, nothing to complain-nothing to write home about. All these compared to the price I paid- good value for money BKK-DEL: Morning flight, same equipment, same IFE. But the only variable factor, in flight service, fell like nine pins. Type of meal I prefer finished by the time it came to me, since this is a morning flight, they were not serving drinks (never seen that before).

I have travelled Air India many times and taken advantage of their ‘airport upgrade’ service whereby once can move from economy to business for a relatively reasonable fee. However, this trip I received a mail in advance saying I could arrange over the phone to increase certainty of a seat within 24hrs. I thought fantastic – but in hindsight I wish I had never received the mail. After the first 20 mins phone call they advised I was too early and so arranged call back. This was executed, but done two hours later and so again not within the 24hrs so another wasted 20mins. I called back the next day to arrange and 20mins later was advised it was completed and would see new ticket issued. It didn’t come but my CR card notified of a transaction and so I assumed all good. I got to airport ready to have an easy journey with no fuss. First off I was advised no upgrade been done, no record. I showed CR Card and asked them to sort out whereby everyone walked away and left me for 10mins until I insisted in speaking to the most senior person. The Duty Manager has not a single ounce of customer service in his body! No acknowledgement, no sorry no apology. After another 15-20mins they tell me the transaction was cancelled and refunded as they forgot to charge the GST. And so I should pay again! At this stage again no apologies or acceptance that this was their problem not mine. Then I had to go to another area and pay again with no service and no priority.

678," I would not recommend Air India if you are travelling with kids. I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read). I guess they don't care too much about custom."," I would not recommend Air India if you are travelling with kids. I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least.

680,"  London to Cochin via Delhi. Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time.

Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food.

I had to put up an hour's argument to prove my point that its a last minute cancellation and would be difficult for me to rebook a flight from Delhi and it being after 7PM will be even more difficult to find any local flights.

705,"  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights. My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly. I find it difficult to believe that Air India truly wants its employees to treat passengers especially those who have paid a premium to fly in business class to be treated so poorly.","  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights.

706,"  Goa to London via Mumbai. We flew air India on the 12/13th February 2017 initially from Goa to Mumbai. The flight was delayed to Mumbai by 30 minutes, then we were told the flight would be 1 hour delayed, in the end the flight was delayed by over 3 hours resulting in our connecting flight on Jet Airways being missed back to the UK. The whole experience was handled very poorly by the ground staff at Goa, there were no announcements regarding the reason why or any updates. After 2 hours, more passengers started to arrive for the later flight so it was obvious that the two flights were being combined. On arrival and at check in, we were handed boarding passes with a capital D printed on the boarding pass, indicating delayed but the new arrivals were issued regular boarding passes. As it turned out, we departed Goa at 01.30 on the 12th February, we knew by this stage that the connecting flight was not possible. On our arrival at Mumbai we were left to our own devices with Air India totally washing their hands of our situation. The ground staff were aggressive, dismissive, rude and generally not getting involved. At one point we were sent to the customer information desk in the airport, it was not an Air India information desk, just a general desk for airport services. Jet Airways would have nothing to do with us either, blaming the other airline, (this will be another review). We ended up buying 2 new tickets on Air India to Birmingham via Delhi, (it was the only flight out that morning,) would you believe it but this flight was delayed by 2.5hrs so we missed our connecting flight once again. We were offered the next flight out to London Heathrow, we had boarding passes issued, collected our luggage, checked in again and rushed to the departure gate, managed to get on the plane and would you believe: we were delayed by another 2 hours. It appears this is a very common everyday issue for this airline. On my return to the UK, I was informed by other travellers that the exact same delay occurred on the Friday night. The flight was not the best, an old Boeing 777, dirty interior, absolutely filthy toilets that smelled terrible. The inflight entertainment system on our seats stopped working after 40 minutes, this happened on 2 occasions so we were not able to watch anything in full, not even the shorter programs. My only praise for this whole experience were the cabin crew on this leg from Delhi to Heathrow, they were jolly, chatty and polite. Since my return, I have tried to contact Air India numerous times for a delayed flight certificate, but with no reply. I'm not sure if they have any customer support in the UK but if they do, they dont want to be found. I was told to travel to Heathrow to Air India ticket office to collect the certificate. 500 miles round trip from my home, I dont think that will happen. So my overall view of Air India is not a good one, I personally would not fly them again unless there were no other carrier's flying to that particular airport. One piece of advice, if your flying to join another flight in Mumbai please give yourself ample time at least 6 hours if not more just in case of delays.","  Goa to London via Mumbai.

707,"  
We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.","

708,"  I have received a particularly poor experience from Air India and would like to pass this feedback onto other travellers as I don't want anyone else to suffer as I have done. Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

710,"  Flew Air India direct from New York to Delhi round trip. Flight departed late both times. Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either.","  Flew Air India direct from New York to Delhi round trip. Flight departed late both times. Air India did a poor job of queue management both times.

714," This flight from Bodhgaya to Delhi was the latest of about 20 domestic flights sectors completed with Air India over the last 3 - 4 years. The level of service has remained consistent in all areas, with some aspects of service stronger than others. This flight was originally due to depart Bodhgaya at 14.35h arriving in Delhi at 16.25h. An initial delay to a revised 16.00h departure was notified by e-mail several hours in advance. Check-in queue management at Bodhgaya airport was poor but agent service was good once you eventually got to the check-in desk. After further delay at Bodhgaya airport the flight eventually departed shortly after 18.00h and arrived at Delhi at about 20.00h. Not a single delay announcement was made at Bodhgaya airport and the information board simply showed the word 'delay' next to the flight number. We had no idea how long the delay would be until we saw our aircraft land. Except for an expensive coffee kiosk there were no customer facilities while waiting. The flight itself was straightforward and typical of one on Air India's short-haul A320 fleet with friendly, patient, efficient cabin crew and reasonably comfortable seating in a slightly grubby cabin. A simple in-flight snack was served. No announcements from the captain except an abrupt order for cabin crew to take their seats for take off and again for landing. Cabin crew announcements included a sincere apology for the delay. Arrived at Delhi's Terminal 3 where we exited through the international arrivals section because our flight had originated in Yangon, Burma, before picking up passengers in Bodhgaya. This meant that the domestic passengers among us had to join a long slow-moving queue to clear, bizarrely, passport control, where just two desks were dedicated to clearing many domestic passengers, presumably from several flights. It took more than an hour just to get as far as the baggage hall. The lesson is to remember to leave plenty of time if you take a domestic flight with Air India before connecting to an international flight."," This flight from Bodhgaya to Delhi was the latest of about 20 domestic flights sectors completed with Air India over the last 3 - 4 years.

727,"  London to Delhi. Overall the flying experience was acceptable. The check-in was smooth and boarding well organised. Onboard the aircraft looked tired. Flight landed 20 mins early. The best part of the flight was possibly the seat leg room and pitch which were generous for economy class and make a huge difference on a long haul flight. IFE is poor particularly if you are not Indian. I was shocked that the music channels were exclusively Indian - I mean not a single English channel. Drinks service - choice of beverages was poor. Dinner main course was one of the tastiest airline food I've had but portions were tiny. Starter and dessert poor. Breakfast was a joke - a small bowl of fruit and 2 cheap mini croissants. Tea was great. If you do not like curry, make sure to book a continental meal (Air India offer western meal as a special meal that can be pre-booked). Cabin crew were courteous and did a good job. A passenger complained of breathlessness and I saw crew provide timely attention. A flight attendant serving me had a genuine smile, helping out an elderly couple who seemed to be a bit frazzled by the flying experience. ","  London to Delhi.

729," Sydney to Paris CDG via Delhi with Air India. Having read the other reviews online, which are less than flattering, I booked with hesitation. Overall, the experience wasn't nearly as horrifying as I'd expected. The flight was comfortable, the seat and legroom was great (and I'm over 6 feet tall); Economy class has an amazing seat pitch on the Air India Dreamliner. Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap. As long as you bring some snacks, a book or iPad, and a calm temperament, you'll survive at the very least."," Sydney to Paris CDG via Delhi with Air India.

734,"  London to Delhi. I travel business class to India 6 to 8 times and started flying Air India from last year. I am now being harassed by the airline to verify my identity online, but the website link provided by AI does not allow me to do so and phone calls are no help. The meagre flying return air miles are suspended until the verification takes place. I tried to complain, but after filling in the extraordinarily long list of requirements on the website complaint form the submit button would not function. Utterly diabolical. Onboard service and food are abysmal and ground staff pretty awful too, without any real courtesy towards business class passengers spending thousands of pounds (on one flight they tried to downgrade me to economy class without explanation and only relented when I began to phone a Indian Union Cabinet Minister friend). There is no email to which one can write and the CMD is apparently completely unavailable.  I am travelling BA tomorrow, having abandoned Air India which I flew out of a misguided desire to help India's national airline. ","  London to Delhi.

I am now being harassed by the airline to verify my identity online, but the website link provided by AI does not allow me to do so and phone calls are no help. The meagre flying return air miles are suspended until the verification takes place. I tried to complain, but after filling in the extraordinarily long list of requirements on the website complaint form the submit button would not function. Utterly diabolical. Onboard service and food are abysmal and ground staff pretty awful too, without any real courtesy towards business class passengers spending thousands of pounds (on one flight they tried to downgrade me to economy class without explanation and only relented when I began to phone a Indian Union Cabinet Minister friend). There is no email to which one can write and the CMD is apparently completely unavailable.

759,"  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Air India. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi to connect with AI314 to Hong Kong, departing at 11pm. In Delhi I lost my boarding pass, and alerted the crew at the gate immediately. They sent me running to the duty free to check if they had found it, but when I ran back telling them that I didn't find it, they told me they wouldn't be able to reissue me with a new one, and that I'd have to rebook on the same flight 24 hours later. I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport. This seven hour ordeal is not over yet, as I am writing this review from Delhi airport, 27 hours after initially leaving Mumbai. The direct flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong is only just over 5 hours. Air India have wasted my time, money, and have shown themselves to be a company with a culture of complete indifference towards their customers. I may have lost my boarding pass, but these things happen, and some understanding and assistance on their part would have been greatly appreciated. To add to my negative experience, two of their crew told me - separately - that they would have issued me with a new boarding pass had they been working at the desk at the time. Air India deprived me of sleep, wasted my time, and also my money, for something that could've been taken care of easily and left me a satisfied customer.","  Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi.

761,"  Air India from Mumbai to Bangalore return.  I was a bit skeptical of the timings as they tend to reschedule a lot based on others experiences. However, my both flights were close to schedule, with a slight 20-min delay which is common when flying in and out of Mumbai. The best part of the flight was surprisingly, the crew who were mostly young and going out of their way on the service front. Food was decent too. I got to fly on the classic A320 on the return leg, which was old but a nice memory for sure. Their seats/leg room is better than other Indian carriers, especially if one happens to be above 6ft. The only glitch I faced from them was for the seat selection, which I had selected for both flights, but at checkin found I was on different seats for both legs. The overall experience however was pleasant, with both the nice and swank BOMT2 and BLR terminals.","  Air India from Mumbai to Bangalore return.

I got to fly on the classic A320 on the return leg, which was old but a nice memory for sure. Their seats/leg room is better than other Indian carriers, especially if one happens to be above 6ft. The only glitch I faced from them was for the seat selection, which I had selected for both flights, but at checkin found I was on different seats for both legs. The overall experience however was pleasant, with both the nice and swank BOMT2 and BLR terminals.","[('Air', 'n'), ('India', 'n'), ('Mumbai', 'n'), ('Bangalore', 'n'), ('return', 'n'), ('.', None), ('bit', 'a'), ('skeptical', 'a'), ('timings', 'n'), ('tend', 'v'), ('reschedule', 'v'), ('lot', 'n'), ('based', 'v'), ('others', 'n'), ('experiences', 'n'), ('.', None), ('However', 'r'), (',', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('close', 'a'), ('schedule', 'n'), (',', None), ('slight', 'a'), ('20-min', 'a'), ('delay', 'n'), ('common', 'a'), ('flying', 'v'), ('Mumbai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('best', 'a'), ('part', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('surprisingly', 'r'), (',', None), ('crew', 'n'), ('mostly', 'r'), ('young', 'a'), ('going', 'v'), ('way', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('front', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Food', 'n'), ('decent', 'a'), ('.', None), ('got', 'v'), ('fly', 'v'), ('classic', 'a'), ('A320', 'n'), ('return', 'n'), ('leg', 'n'), (',', None), ('old', 'a'), ('nice', 'a'), ('memory', 'n'), ('sure', 'a'), ('.', None), ('seats/leg', 'a'), ('room', 'n'), ('better', 'a'), ('Indian', 'a'), ('carriers', 'n'), (',', None), ('especially', 'r'), ('one', None), ('happens', 'v'), ('6ft', None), ('.', None), ('glitch', 'n'), ('faced', 'v'), ('seat', 'n'), ('selection', 'n'), (',', None), ('selected', 'v'), ('flights', 'n'), (',', None), ('checkin', 'a'), ('found', 'v'), ('different', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('legs', 'n'), ('.', None), ('overall', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('however', 'r'), ('pleasant', 'a'), (',', None), ('nice', 'a'), ('swank', 'a'), ('BOMT2', 'n'), ('BLR', 'n'), ('terminals', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Air India Mumbai Bangalore return . bit skeptical timing tend reschedule lot base others experience .

763,"  Sydney to Abu Dhabi via Delhi with Air India. Worst business class experience so far. We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed. The shabbiness of the plane and the uninspired, almost reluctant service is not a financial problem, it's an attitude issue.","  Sydney to Abu Dhabi via Delhi with Air India.

The flight was nearly half empty and was smooth. However, the aircraft interior was very dull and not properly maintained.

Imagine how a person can survive such an ultra-long haul flight without any entertainment or reading! Many places, they put duct tape to cover the cracks below the entertainment system and tray. Just within three hours into the flight, the toilets were very smelly. The food was ok. However, the cabin crews were not professional and pleasant. They were taking so much rest in between for many hours without providing any service or refreshments.
